Yale University Policy on Conflict of Interest (view full policy at: https://your.yale.edu/research-support/conflict-interest-office/policies-procedures-guidance)

YDR Conflict of Interest Policy

Principals for External Clinical, Consulting & Educational Activities

For engagement in sponsored research, in consulting, education or in other interactions with external organizations

Yale Diagnostic Radiology (YDR) has articulated the following principles to help faculty members identify and address potential, actual and apparent conflicts of interest and commitment associated with external clinical and educational activities. The fundamental premise is that each member of the Yale community has an obligation to act in the best interest of the University and in furtherance of the University's mission, and must not let outside activities or outside financial interests interfere with those obligations. Yale University’s complete policy on conflict of the interest and conflict of commitment can be viewed at: https://provost.yale.edu/

The following principles may help YDR faculty members identify and avoid potential conflicts of interest and commitment:

1. External activities should not compromise an individual's ability to perform ALL the activities (henceforth known as YDR duties) expected of him or her as a YDR faculty member, including:
   a. expected clinical and academic responsibilities
   b. requirements as stipulated for the clinical supplement (i.e. requirements necessary for adequate functioning of YDR as a whole)

2. Time commitments for external activities should be realistically assessed such that they should not compromise YDR duties.
   a. This is especially true when one takes on multiple external activities
   b. External commitments must not preclude one from being available for emergency clinical coverage

3. YDR facilities, equipment, and personnel should be used only for YDR activities and purposes (such as teleradiology), except when other uses are specifically authorized by the YDR Chair. University resources should not be used for external consulting activities, including outside legal work, that are not performed under contract with Yale University. Such resources include conference rooms, secretarial support, and office supplies.

4. External clinical activities at competing institutions may represent a conflict of interest unless there is a reciprocal benefit to YDR.

5. Lectures at outside institutions must also be presented to YDR trainees within a 2 year period (if material is deemed appropriate for the trainees).

6. Faculty members must update their conflict of interest and conflict of commitment disclosures with each new external activity.","The provided markdown contains both links to related policies and an actual policy text. The policy text begins with the 'Conflict of Interest' header and details the YDR Conflict of Interest Policy, including principles and guidelines for faculty regarding external engagements.

In pursuit of its own mission, and consistent with the requirements of external agencies, particularly the federal government, Yale University has formulated the [Policy on Conflict of Interest](/policies-procedures/other/yale-university-policy-conflict-interest) to identify and address potential, actual and apparent conflicts of interest and commitment. This policy is intended to increase the awareness of faculty, staff and students to the potential for conflicts of interest and commitment and to establish procedures whereby such conflicts may be avoided or properly managed.
---
Disclosure of External Activities and Financial Interests
All faculty members with University appointments of greater than 50%; all faculty who hold administrative positions; and all faculty and non–faculty personnel who are responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of research are required annually to submit a disclosure of their external activities and financial interests.
---
Yale Faculty Handbook
Section XX.E., “Outside Interests and Employment”, of Yale’s Faculty Handbook provides guidance about the amount of time that faculty members may devote to outside activities; it stipulates, for example, that a faculty member may not accept salaried employment at another institution while a full–time employee of Yale, that faculty may not spend more than one day in a seven–day work week on consulting activities, and that faculty ownership or management of private enterprises is subject to review and limitations. A link to the [Faculty Handbook](http://provost.yale.edu/faculty-handbook) is available on the Provost’s Office website.
---
Purchasing Conflict of Interest (applies to faculty and staff)
According to Yale’s [General Purchasing Policy 3201](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/3201-general-purchasing), a purchasing conflict of interest exists when a Yale employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a supplier considered for a Yale purchasing transaction. Prior to purchasing or requesting goods or services from any entity in which you have a financial interest, contact Yale’s Purchasing Department for guidance, as additional disclosure requirements and certain restrictions may apply.
---
Staff Workplace Policies
Full–time non–faculty employees are expected to satisfy all of the requirements of their jobs, and should not permit outside activities to interfere with the performance of their Yale obligations. Some departments prohibit staff employees from consulting or engaging in other outside employment because of the likelihood of such interference. Other departments may permit certain outside activities, with appropriate notice to and written approval by the employee’s supervisor, so long as they do not interfere with employees’ Yale obligations. The [Staff Workplace Policies](/work-yale/staff-workplace-policies) set forth the University’s general expectations about staff and the avoidance of conflicts in performance of their duties.
---
Conflict of Interest Disclosure for Senior Administrators
Certain senior, non–faculty administrators designated by the President are also required to submit annual disclosures of outside activities and financial interests. These disclosures must be prepared on the *Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form for Senior Administrators* and submitted to the Office of the Vice President and General Counsel. The form will be provided to those administrators who are designated to submit them.","The provided markdown contains several sections with substantive policy content detailing Yale University’s conflict of interest guidelines.

Policy

It is the policy of Diagnostic Radiology to routinely ask all women of childbearing years (refer to Nursing Policy – childbearing years defined as 10 – 60 years old) if they are pregnant or breastfeeding in all areas of Diagnostic Radiology, with the exception of Ultrasound.

---

Procedure

If the patient indicates that they are not breastfeeding, routine imaging proceeds.

If the patient is breastfeeding:

• For all non-contrast exams, excluding Nuclear Medicine exams, routine imaging proceeds.

• For all IV iodinated contrast and gadolinium, American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines state that contrast administration to the mother is considered safe for both the baby and nursing mother. Mothers who are breastfeeding should be given the opportunity to make an informed decision as to whether to continue or temporarily abstain from breastfeeding after receiving IV contrast. If the mother remains concerned about any potential ill effects to the infant, she may abstain from breast-feeding for 24 hours with active expression and discarding of breast milk from both breasts during that period. In anticipation of this, she may wish to use a breast pump to obtain milk before the contrast study to feed the infant during the 24‑hour period following the examination.

• For all breast-feeding patients who are scheduled for Nuclear Medicine exams and/or procedures, the DR attending physician must be consulted prior to any testing performed.

The DR attending physician will discuss with the patient’s attending if the exam should be postponed, canceled, or if the procedure will be performed.

• Patients who have a Tc‑99m nuclear medicine procedure should not let their infants breastfeed for 72 hours after the exam. During this 72‑hour period they can pump the breast milk and store it. This milk can be given to the infant after it has been stored for 72 hours. The patient only needs to pump and store the breast milk for 72 hours after the exam has been completed. The milk does not need to be discarded because of the nuclear test.

• For patients who can have the exam postponed, the patient can pump prior to returning for the test and freeze the milk. This stored milk can be given to the infant when the patient returns for the exam. Immediately following the exam, the patient should continue to pump the breast milk for 72 hours and properly store it so that the isotope has time to decay prior to giving it to the infant.

• For other radioisotopes, consult with the NM attending physician or RSO regarding the appropriate waiting period before resuming breast‑feeding or using stored breast milk.","The document contains a clearly demarcated policy section titled 'Diagnostic Radiology Procedures on Breastfeeding Patients' with subsections for Policy and Procedure.

• Metformin (Glucophage/Glucophage XR, Glumetza, Riomet, Fortamet)
• Alogliptin/metformin (Kazano)
• Canagliflozin/metformin (Invokamet/Invokamet XR)

• Saxagliptin/metformin (Kombiglyze XR)
• Sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet/Janumet XR)
• Vildagliptin/metformin (Eucreas)

Why should I be taking my metformin differently?
In rare instances, Metformin can cause a severe side effect called lactic acidosis. This risk is elevated in patients with decreased kidney function (an eGFR less than 30 mL/min), as iodinated contrast dye can further increase that risk.

What should I do?
• If you have decreased kidney function (eGFR less than 30 mL/min):
  - Stop taking metformin or metformin-containing products and contact your doctor within 48 hours before restarting.
  - Bring the accompanying form with you to your doctor’s appointment.
• If you have normal kidney function (eGFR 30 mL/min or greater):
  - Continue taking metformin as originally prescribed.

Questions or concerns:
If you have any questions or concerns, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.","The markdown content contains a clear clinical guideline addressing how diabetic patients taking Metformin (under the brand names Glucophage or Glucovance) should manage their medication in relation to receiving iodinated contrast dye.

Policy for administering water soluble oral contrast to patients with a history of prior IV contrast reaction:

• The oral contrast used for CT for in-patients and ER patients is dilute water soluble iodinated contrast (omnipaque). Approximately 1-2% of this is absorbed through the gut in normal patients. Therefore, there is a theoretic risk of a contrast reaction in a patient with a previous IV contrast allergy who gets oral omnipaque.
• Patients with a history of previous moderate or severe reaction to IV contrast should receive barium Readicat or the scan can be done without oral contrast.
• Moderate reactions are defined as: tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, generalized or diffuse erythema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, wheezing, laryngeal edema, mild hypotension.
• Severe reactions are defined as: severe or rapidly progressing laryngeal edema, unresponsiveness, cardiopulmonary arrest, convulsions, profound hypotension, clinically manifest arrhythmias.

Please note for certain Enterography focused exams with CT and MRI the patient may be asked to drink Volumen oral contrast. There are no significant contraindications for this agent and it can be given safely in patients with reported Sulfa Allergies.

The recommendations are intended to ensure that patients are informed about and receive appropriate shielding when undergoing imaging procedures.

For detailed procedures and related policies, please refer to the links below within the radiology patient care policies section.","The provided content contains a clear policy section that outlines guidelines for gonadal shielding recommendations, which is actual policy text.

Low-osmolar iodinated contrast has been shown to have a weak association with exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis-related symptoms, most commonly respiratory compromise. This association has been discussed with Yale Neurology who feel that the low risk does not merit screening patients for Myasthenia at this point. If a patient declares himself or herself as suffering from Myasthenia Gravis, our policy should be to reassure them that it is highly unlikely that any deterioration in symptoms will occur.","The document contains actual policy text detailing guidelines concerning the use of low-osmolar iodinated contrast in patients with Myasthenia Gravis.

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the Department of Radiology's process for clinical shift scheduling and provide guidance for faculty who may sign up for two shifts within a single 24-hour period. Prolonged and overlapping shifts, as well as extended double shifts, may lead to increased stress, fatigue, and lack of concentration. These effects may, in turn, impact patient safety with data within and outside of medicine showing higher rates of unintentional error. It is the goal of the department to allow adequate gaps between assigned clinical shifts to ensure faculty are given an adequate period to rest/recover.

---

B. Scope

1. The SOP applies to all YDR clinical shifts, exclusive of emergent afterhours work done during a call shift.

---

C. Procedures

1. Double shifts
   a. Faculty should not be assigned or sign up for more than 2 shifts in a 24-hour period and should not work more than 15 hours in a 24-hour window.
      i. Evening and overnight shifts require an 8-hour gap between shifts. Rare exceptions may be made under special circumstances, with the approval of the Chair's office and the relevant division/section chief.
      ii. A shift represents a day, evening, or overnight session. As such, faculty should not take more than 2 shifts in one working day. Rare exceptions may be made under special circumstances, with the approval of the Chair's office and the relevant division/section chief.
2. Overlapping/Synchronous Shifts
   a. No faculty should be scheduled for synchronous shifts. If this does take place, only 1 shift credit will be applied.
   b. Consecutive shifts can take place, with the following caveats:
      i. Overlapping shifts will receive credit prorated to the overlapping shift hours.
      ii. Untimed shifts will count as a full 9-hour shift during the day it is assigned in Qgenda.

POLICY RATIONALE AND TEXT

University policy 3303 allows for modest occasional gifts to be made to students, employees or immediate family members in expression of sympathy, and to employees for professional achievement in a limited number of situations as defined in this policy.

Federal law and regulations restrict the use of University assets to make gifts to individuals or other organizations. The University must therefore provide for proper accounting treatment in the limited instances where such gifts are allowable.

3303.2 Expressions of Sympathy or Employee Recognition or Retirement/Departure/Milestones

• The University prohibits cash gifts to employees. No gifts of any kind should be charged to federal or non-federal grants.
• Employees: Non-cash gifts of $75 or greater and all gift certificates given to employees must be reported to the Payroll Office for IRS reporting; the amount is added as taxable income to their payroll records.
• Non-Employees: Non-cash gifts of $75 or greater and all cash/gift certificates given to non-employees must be reported to Accounts Payable for IRS reporting.
• A non-cash gift with a value up to $400 can be provided for the retirement (or other departure) of longstanding employees with at least 10 years of service.

------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE

This SOP is developed in accordance with University policy 3303 to guide Yale Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging staff and faculty on when and how to provide gifts related to retirements, expressions of sympathy, departures, and milestones throughout the year.

------------------------------------------------------------
Approval Statement

All gifts given to faculty or staff that meet the above criteria of policy 3303 must be approved by department leadership before being purchased to comply with University accounting guidelines.

------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSIBILITY

The department may provide a gift to staff/faculty in the following situations:
• Retirements
• Voluntary Departures of faculty or staff with at least 5 years of service
• Death of an immediate family member
• Birth and adoptions
• Illness

In most cases, the gift will be sent by the Chair's office on behalf of the department. If the Chair's office has not sent a gift, Business Office approval must be obtained before a Section/Staff account gift is purchased using a p-card.

• No more than one gift may be purchased using departmental funds.
• Non-retirement gifts must not exceed the $75 IRS requirement.
• Any additional purchases or gifts will be covered personally by the individual who made the purchase.

A. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the YDR policy for using continuing medical education (CME) and conference time. Faculty may enroll in virtual courses, but are strongly encouraged to attend subspecialty oriented courses. Faculty on the Clinical Educator track should not use CME/conference time to attend virtual meetings if possible, as CE faculty need to go to meetings, give talks, garner a national reputation, mentor junior faculty and promote Yale.
---
B. Scope
This SOP applies to all clinical YDR faculty.
---
C. Procedures
1. All clinical faculty should attend CME courses each year to fulfill CT license requirements.
2. CT license requirements: ""A licensed physician applying for renewal shall earn a minimum of fifty contact hours of qualifying continuing medical education within the preceding twenty-four month period. One contact hour means a minimum of fifty minutes of continuing education activity."" CMEs must also include 1-2 hours of specific training.
3. Virtual CME
   a. Taking CME days to ""attend"" a virtual course or to review archived courses is dependent upon adequate clinical coverage similar to attendance at all meetings and is at the discretion of the division/section chief.
   b. Expenses other than registration or purchase of course materials cannot be charged to staff accounts.
4. Faculty are given 10 days of CME each year and these are included in PTO days
   a. CE faculty may take more than 10 conference days, using allotted academic time with approval from their division/section chief.
5. CME/conference hotel expenses should not exceed $500 / night (inclusive of taxes and fees). Anything over $500/night (net including taxes) requires pre-authorization by the Chair's office.
6. Receipts submitted over $500 submitted without pre-authorization will not be fully approved and reimbursement will be capped at $500.

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to provide guidance for clinical faculty staff accounts. A staff account is a fund used only to pay (on a tax free basis) for work related activities and professional fees, as well as for faculty development.
---
B. Scope
This SOP applies to all YDR clinical faculty.
---
C. Procedures
1. Up to $6500 will be made available each year for professional development, to be used at each faculty member’s discretion.
   a. This amount is exclusive of additional mandatory payments provided by YDR including CT medical license ($575), ABR dues ($340) and ACR dues ($900). If a faculty member needs to have a DEA license, this will also be covered.
   b. Funds should be used for professional society memberships, CME courses, computer equipment to support professional commitments, and travel related expenses for academic pursuits.
      - No Amazon purchases are allowed unless pre-approved by the business office.
      - Up to $350 may be spent on a desk for a home workstation.
      - All computer purchases must be made through the IT Department.
      - Apple watches and wireless headphones are not permitted as an expense.
      - CME/conference hotel expenses should not exceed $500/night (inclusive of taxes and fees). Anything over $500/night requires pre-authorization by the Chair's office.
   c. The faculty p-card is encouraged for all expenses. If personal credit cards are used, expenses may not be fully reimbursed unless the faculty member submits receipts within 120 days of purchase.
   d. Expenses submitted after 120 days of purchase are subject to taxable income per IRS guidelines.

2. Staff accounts will be capped at $15,000.
   a. Any overage above $15,000 will be transferred to the relevant section fund.
      - Section fund spending should support the section and be transparent to all section members.
   b. On July 1 of each academic year, if the staff account balance is between $8,500 and $14,999, the staff account will be replenished up to $15,000.
   c. Section funds will be capped at $25,000. Any overages at year’s end will be transferred to a new departmental faculty development account for clinical research, international outreach, faculty education, faculty well-being, etc.
      - At the discretion of the Chair, some section funds may not be capped at $25,000 (e.g., if a section is using funds to hire a new fellow).

3. Retirees working on a per diem basis will not have access to staff accounts unless working >50% FTE per diem.
4. Faculty working through phased retirement will continue to receive the standard (full) staff account monies.
5. Part-time faculty working at least .50 FTE will be entitled to the standard (full) staff account.
6. Purchases made by faculty who have offered their resignation should not use their p-card unless approved in advance by the business office.
7. Faculty who have a deficit at year end will need to pay the department back by July 30th of the next fiscal year.
8. Faculty on extended leave (sick/disability/childcare) may only use staff accounts to maintain society memberships/membership dues. Other expenses must be reviewed and approved by the business office and Chair.

1.0 Purpose

Because there is no current departmental procedure for NIH publication costs, the purpose of this document is to provide support for the growing cost of these.

Open Access requirements for NIH grant funded publications now require sizeable publication costs. While these can be charged to grants, many publications are accepted once the grant funding period is over and award funding is no longer available.

2.0 Scope

This standard operating procedure (SOP) sets out the requirements for the appropriate management of publication costs. This SOP provides Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging faculty and staff with guidelines to follow for payment for publication costs.

3.0 Procedures

A departmental publication fund will be created for FY23. Faculty who have no other resource for publication funding (startups, dowries, discretionary funds, staff accounts etc) may apply to the VC for Scientific Research for access to the fund. Once the fund is depleted, no additional monies will be made available. The fund will be replenished at the start of each academic year. Each faculty member should not be expected to exceed funding from this source in excess of $4,000 / year.

There are potential risks in the MR environment, not only for the patient but also for the accompanying family members, attending health care professionals and others who find themselves only occasionally or rarely in the magnetic fields of MR scanners, such as security, housekeeping personnel, firefighters, police, etc. This manual has been developed to help guide the MR staff regarding these issues.

The policies written in this manual are guidelines to follow as a standard of care throughout the Yale New Haven Health system MRI departments. It is at the discretion of the supervising radiology attending to divert from any policy in an emergency situation. Please refer to page 101 ""Exceptions of MR safety policies"" for further detail.

It is the intent of the Yale New Haven Hospital safety manual to:
• Protect and educate all patients, direct and ancillary personnel about the possible risks associated with the MR Suite (including but not limited to static and time-varying magnetic fields as well as RF pulses).
• Remain in compliance with the most up-to-date MR safety information provided by the Joint Commission and the ACR.
• Serve as a helpful guide as the field of MRI continues to evolve, supporting MR services that are among the most powerful yet safest of all diagnostic procedures in modern medicine.

Furthermore, the following guidelines apply:
1. All clinical and research MR sites, regardless of magnet format or field strength—and covering diagnostic, research, interventional, and/or surgical applications—must maintain MR safety policies.
2. These policies and procedures will be reviewed regularly by the MR Safety Officer and the Medical Director to accommodate significant changes in the MR center environment (including standards from the ACR, Joint Commission, and international bodies).
3. Responsibility for implementing and maintaining these policies and procedures rests with the Medical Director of the YNHH MRI Centers.
4. All MR personnel shall review MR safety annually.
5. All non‐MR staff, patients, and their families must be provided appropriate materials (such as guidelines, brochures, or posters) that explain potential accidents and adverse events in the MRI environment.
6. Updated safety policies must be accessible to MR staff—either online or in a hard copy in every MR area.
7. Any MR safety incident or near miss must be reported promptly to the center manager, the MR Safety Officer, and the Medical Director. An event report should be documented (via the intranet and, if equipment is involved, reported to the FDA Maude website at www.fda.gov/medwatch).

---

The MR task group of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International has developed a set of MR safety terms. Note that this terminology is not applied retrospectively to implants and devices approved by the FDA under the labels ""MR safe"" or ""MR compatible"" if they were tested prior to December 2005. Furthermore, products marketed with vague descriptions such as ""nonmagnetic"" or the outdated term ""MR compatible"" should not be assumed to adhere to current ASTM classifications.

ASTM has introduced corresponding icons (which may appear in the document as image links) to standardize safety labels:
• MR SAFE – An item that poses no known hazards in any MRI environment. For example, non-conducting, nonmetallic, non-magnetic items (like a plastic Petri dish) are considered MR Safe. (Icon: letters ""MR"" in green on a white square with a green border or white on a green square.)
• MR CONDITIONAL – An item that has been shown to be safe in a specific MR environment under defined conditions. (Icon: the letters ""MR"" in black inside a yellow triangle with a black border, with labeling that includes test results and conditions of use.)
• MR UNSAFE – An item known to pose hazards in all MRI environments (e.g., ferromagnetic scissors). (Icon: the letters ""MR"" in black on a white field, inside a red circle with a diagonal red band.)
• Safety in MRI Not Evaluated – For devices with no provided MRI safety information.

![img-0.jpeg](images/img-0.jpeg.png)

The ACR has established a 4‐zone concept (per the ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices, 2007) to provide progressive access restrictions within the MRI environment:
• Zone I: Open to the general public; typically the area outside the controlled MR environment.
• Zone II: A transition area between the public Zone I and the strictly controlled areas; access here is limited to patients, family members, and hospital personnel who have undergone initial MR safety screening.

![img-1.jpeg](images/img-1.jpeg.png)

• Zone III: Areas adjacent to the scanner (leading into Zone IV) where potentially hazardous MR energies may exist. This zone is physically restricted—only MR personnel (with appropriate keys or passcodes) have free access. Patients and pre-screened personnel may enter only when accompanied by designated MR staff.
• Zone IV: The room that houses the MR scanner itself, clearly marked as hazardous due to very strong magnetic fields. Only patients (or their family members) and hospital staff accompanied by properly screened MR personnel are permitted here.

![img-2.jpeg](images/img-2.jpeg.png)

Non‐MR personnel must be accompanied at all times by a designated MR staff member when in Zones III or IV.

---

SITE ACCESS RESTRICTIONS:

• MRI Center, Fitkin Basement:
The MRI outpatient center at 789 Howard Avenue uses a prep hold area adjacent to MR 5 and MR 1 for transferring stretcher or wheelchair-bound patients onto MR safe equipment. To help prevent overcrowding and potential safety incidents, no more than three additional hospital staff members are allowed per procedural MRI.

• Smilow (Level 2), MRI Suite:
Located on the second floor at 20 Park Street of the Smilow Cancer Hospital, this MRI suite transfers stretcher and wheelchair-bound patients to a prep hold area equipped with MR safe devices. Staff accompanying any procedural MRI is similarly restricted to three people to mitigate risks.

• Smilow (Level 1) Breast Center MRI Suite:
At 20 Park Street on the first floor of the Smilow Cancer Hospital, the Breast Center MRI Suite is divided into four zones. Stretcher-bound patients are preferentially scheduled on the second floor MRI suite, and wheelchair-bound patients are transferred to MR safe equipment in the changing area.

• North Haven, MRI Suite:
The MRI suite at 6 Devine Street in North Haven is organized into four zones. Here, stretcher and wheelchair-bound patients are transferred to designated MR safe equipment in the transfer area.

• Pediatric Suite, West Pavilion:
Located on the second floor of the YNHH Children's Hospital, the Pediatric MRI Suite utilizes MR safe stretchers in the MRI intake room for stretcher-bound patients. For procedural MR examinations, the accompanying hospital staff is limited to three individuals to avoid overcrowding and enhance safety.","The provided markdown includes extensive excerpts from an MRI Safety Manual issued by Yale New Haven Hospital’s Diagnostic Radiology Department.

Objectives

Allocate appropriate TSL (triennial/sabbatical leave) to all full‐time (i.e., 100% FTE) clinical faculty (Academic Clinician and Clinician Educator/Scholar tracks) at the Associate Professor and Full Professor rank to provide opportunities:
1. For professional growth and development so that they may serve more effectively in their field of specialization and/or in their academic pursuits; and
2. To step back from clinical duties in order to help restore/maintain energy, stamina and enthusiasm.

---

TSL Application and Approval Process

1. Transparent and fair.
2. Supervised by the TSL Committee.
3. Faculty become eligible for TSL two years following promotion to Associate Professor.
4. Faculty are eligible 2.5 years from the January or July following the end of the previous TSL.
5. Eligible faculty will be notified in the fall of the year prior to the beginning of the academic year in which they will be eligible for TSL. In order to obtain Department and University approval, the completed application form must be submitted and approved by the TSL Committee and Departmental Chair before the beginning of December prior to the onset of the proposed TSL year.

---

TSL Committee

1. The TSL Committee will be a standing committee in the Yale Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging.
   a. Members will be appointed by the Departmental Chair.
   b. It will consist of a faculty member Chair and up to six additional faculty members representing assistant, associate, and full professors within the department on both Academic Clinician and Clinician Educator/Scholar tracks.
   c. There are no set term limits, but membership (including the number of members) is subject to change at the discretion of the Departmental Chair.
   d. The Committee will meet as often as necessary to fulfill the needs of the department and its faculty.
2. The TSL Committee will review TSL applications for merit and benefits regarding individual career progression as well as benefits to the Department/School/Clinical Service. Eligible faculty may have the option to provide a brief presentation of proposals to the Committee.

---

TSL Details

1. Each eligible faculty member is invited to submit a robust leave plan.
2. The TSL Committee will grade applications in order of merit, based on individual career development potential and overall departmental benefit.
3. At least one Academic Clinician track and one Clinician Educator/Scholar track application will be approved.
4. The top 3 TSL applications ('formal TSL') will be selected and discussed with the relevant section chiefs/Chair for planning purposes.
5. Successful applicants will be informed that their submission is under consideration and that the dates and duration are determined by the section chief and committee. The time awarded will be 2 months.
6. Once leave has been defined, successful applicants will be informed that they are eligible to take a leave of absence for the specific time period in order to execute their proposal.
7. TSL will be treated like parental leave; that is, schedules will be adjusted to allow the leave to take place.
8. Successful formal TSL candidates will present the results/value of their leave to the TSL Committee each year.
9. Formal TSL must be taken in uninterrupted 1-month blocks during which the faculty member may not work clinically or earn additional departmental dollars.
10. Parental leave of absence, as mandated by the University, will have priority over TSL.
11. Following approval, formal TSL may be limited, changed, postponed, or canceled before or after commencement based on departmental and sectional clinical needs. While the department will strive to accommodate requests, not all requests may receive the same amount of TSL.
12. TSL will normally be granted for faculty in phased retirement.
13. Other approved requests will be allocated 2 weeks of TSL time over the academic year (termed 'eligible TSL'). This time can be used at the requestor’s discretion, worked through, added to PTO time to create a longer block, or used as leave spread over the academic year. The days cannot be carried over.

---

Deliverables

1. Within one year of completing a formal TSL, the faculty member will provide a one-page summary to the TSL Committee outlining how the TSL was used to meet the approved plan.
2. Faculty may be requested to meet with the TSL Committee (and possibly other invitees) to describe how their formal TSL helped achieve their approved leave objectives.

---

FAQs

Q. What does the faculty handbook say about TSL?
A. University guidance states:
   - It is a privilege and not a right.
   - For accounting purposes, TSL must be taken within the approved period (January–June for January 1st eligibility, July–June for July 1st eligibility).
   - If only a portion of the formal TSL is taken during the awarded academic year, the remaining time may not roll over.
   - No faculty member may have more than 6 months of leave (in any combination of leaves) in any 18-month period.

Q. What factors will be considered in the TSL approval process?
A. The TSL Committee will consider the purpose and merits of the leave plan, time needed to execute the plan, time since previous TSL, and the number of past TSLs awarded within the applicant’s clinical section/division.

Q. If there are competing formal TSL requests within a section, what factors are used to prioritize?
A. Considerations include priority, quality of application, time since last TSL, and the number of previous TSLs awarded. No additional weight is given based on leadership role, rank, or track.

Q. Can I augment my income during my formal TSL?
A. No additional income related to radiology clinical work—whether through moonlighting, paid call, teleradiology, or locum tenens—may be earned during a formal TSL.

Q. Does formal TSL mean decreased net income?
A. Faculty who augment income with other departmental activities will not earn that additional income during their TSL; however, they remain eligible for their full Clinical or Academic Productivity Bonus.

Q. How does formal TSL affect the Academic Productivity Bonus in the Clinician Educator/Scholar track?
A. Faculty remain eligible for the full Academic Productivity Bonus regardless of TSL. Failure to meet TSL goals will not negatively impact the bonus, though using TSL to enhance academic output may lead to earlier promotion or a higher bonus per departmental guidelines.

Q. What are the consequences if I do not complete my approved formal TSL plan?
A. Should the TSL Committee determine (after review, including an in-person meeting) that the TSL was not appropriately executed, they may recommend a lower priority for the next available TSL or, in extreme cases, denial of the next TSL.

Q. How does formal TSL affect clinical targets, CME time, vacation time, and supplemental income?
A. Clinical target, academic time, PTO (including vacation and CME), and administrative responsibilities will be prorated based on the granted TSL. Faculty on block TSL may be eligible for Y-payments if required to work above a reduced target during the remainder of the year.

Q. What happens if I am asked to work during my formal TSL?
A. If required to work during a formal TSL, the leave will be deemed canceled (or reduced, with no carryover) depending on the extent of work performed during the TSL period.

Q. How are approved days off for other activities (e.g., section chief or residency responsibilities) incorporated?
A. For example, if a faculty member typically works 120 clinical days/year and is approved for a two-month TSL, they would be expected to work 100 clinical days during that year.

Q. Can parental leave and TSL be taken in the same academic year?
A. While every effort is made to fairly distribute clinical absence, taking both parental leave and TSL in the same academic year is discouraged and may result in reduced or deferred TSL. Additionally, no faculty member may exceed 6 months total leave (any combination of TSL and paternity/parental leave) in any 18-month period.

Q. Are Vice Chairs eligible for TSL?
A. Yes, Vice Chairs are eligible, and their applications will be evaluated by the TSL Committee in the standard manner.

---
1.0 Purpose:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the policy and provide guidance for Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE) within YDR.
---
2.0 Scope:
This SOP applies to all radiologists and licensed independent practitioners employed by YDR with medical staff privileges.
---
3.0 Materials:
Appendix 1 - Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), Radiology OPPE Form
---
4.0 Procedures:
4.1 The Joint Commission (TJC) requires ""Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation"" (OPPE) forms to be completed for all medical providers at the frequency of about every nine months, but not to exceed greater than every 12 months. Per the TJC, an OPPE identifies professional practice trends that may impact the quality and safety of care and applies to all practitioners granted privileges via the Medical Staff chapter requirements. A well-designed process supports early detection and response to performance issues that could negatively impact patient outcomes.

4.2 For Yale Radiology, we have modeled our OPPE to use similar categories as used by the ACGME core competency model encompassing: (1.) Patient Care, (2.) Interpersonal & Communication Skills, (3.) Professionalism, and (4.) SystemsBased Practice (See Appendix 1 for YNHHS Radiology OPPE Form).

4.3 The Departmental Program Manager is responsible for generating OPPE forms for review by the Vice Chair Quality of Safety, Vice Chair Clinical Affairs and/or Section Chief for review and approval, and then final submission to the Departmental Chairman for review.

4.4 Forms will be prepared with pre-populated provider/metric data by departmental administration where applicable. An ""$X$"" will be placed within the appropriate column of 'Acceptable', 'Needs Improvement', or 'Not Applicable' for remaining metrics by the designee assessing the practicing radiologist/LIP.

There are four qualitative assessments on the form within each of the categories, where Division/Section chiefs can provide comments/recommendations for providers who receive a 'Needs Improvement' designation.

4.5 Metrics scored as ""Needs Improvement"" may identify performance issues that could negatively affect patient care. An OPPE is a broad screening tool and it is recognized that many providers who do not meet acceptable or threshold goals for assessed categories will not be deemed as an outlier after further investigation. A ""Focused Professional Practice Evaluation"" (FPPE) may need to be conducted based on review of the OPPE form if the provider is felt to be an outlier for what the department deems an acceptable standard of care. The final decision to consider an FPPE will be made by the Chairman upon review of overall physician performance.

4.6 If physicians were not in the Department for part or all of the identified dates for OPPE, their data will either be pro-rated or labeled Not Applicable (N/A).

Training Management Survey (TMS) and Escalation Policy

• The training management assessment is an online survey that is an annual requirement for all.
• The assessment determines what specific training requirements are required, based on your activities as well as federal, state and University regulations or policies.

The following procedure will be followed to ensure departmental compliance:

1) On a monthly basis, a report will be run for all outstanding individual TMS requirements.
2) Any individuals with outstanding requirements will be contacted via email by ydrtms@yale.edu with details of non-compliance.
3) After 14 days, non-compliant personnel will receive a 2ⁿᵈ notification with cc to their supervisor. Casual employees will not be able to schedule any additional hours until training is complete.
4) Non-compliance at this point will lead to the following consequences:
   - a. Faculty:
       • Staff accounts will be withheld for the following fiscal year.
       • Non-compliance will be counted against merit recommendations.
   - b. M & P Staff:
       • Non-compliance will be a factor in merit recommendations come June of each fiscal year for September increases.
   - c. C & T Staff:
       • Non-compliance will be added to their FOCUS form.
5) HIPAA compliance reports will be run monthly for all outstanding individuals in the department and you will be notified by IT (Jitendra Bhawnani) with details of noncompliance for your timely completion.

Note: Serious ongoing non-compliance could lead to disciplinary actions for any class of employee.

To determine your training requirements:

1. Go to https://www.yale.edu/training (login with your NET id and password).
2. Click on 'Requirements' under 'My Training Information'.
3. Complete any requirements marked with a red X.

Additional Details:
• All Clinical staff should have undergone TB screening (PPD test) as part of their requirement for hospital privileges.
• For immunization requirements, records can be sent to Yale Employee Health Department at employeehealth-business@yale.edu with cc to ydrtms@yale.edu, or faxed to 203-432-7828 (a copy must also be sent to ydrtms@yale.edu).
• If a requirement appears inapplicable, contact tmsadm@yale.edu and CC ydrtms@yale.edu to have your assessment reset.

Radiologists working in the Yale Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging (YDR) can issue a formal interpretation with a report placed in Epic for studies performed at facilities not covered by YDR. Currently all radiology sites affiliated with YNHH/SRC, Milford Hospital and Bridgeport Hospital OutPatient Radiology are staffed by YDR.

Official interpretation of outside imaging by YDR offers a second opinion to patients with interpretation by a tertiary care center sub-specialized Radiologist. Published data has shown that such programs decrease costs, reduce radiation exposure caused by repeat exams, and frequently result in alteration in diagnosis and clinical management.

Your patient's insurance company will be billed a professional fee for the secondary interpretation by a YDR radiologist.

---

What types of studies can be nominated for an official second read:
1. Must be an MRI, CT, PET-CT. All forms of breast imaging are also eligible (mammogram, ultrasound, MRI).
2. Must be less than 90 days old. Do not place requests for outside reads on exams older than 90 days (they will automatically be canceled by YDR Image Library staff except in specific clinical circumstances at discretion of radiologist). Images not eligible for outside interpretation will still be uploaded/viewable in our PACS.

---

Sites eligible for outside reads:
Any hospital/site including Smilow Cancer Center affiliated sites (ex. St. Francis) where the original interpretation is not completed by a YDR Radiologist. This includes exams performed at other Yale-New Haven Health System facilities including Bridgeport Hospital (main campus), Greenwich Hospital, Lawrence and Memorial, and Westerly Hospital. In-patient exams are eligible if the patient is transferred to YNHH or if request is placed after patient discharge (see exception #3 below for further information).

---

Sites not eligible:
1. Bridgeport Hospital Outpatient Radiology locations, including Park Avenue Medical Center, and Milford Hospital are NOT eligible for second reads as exams are interpreted by YDR radiologists.
2. Any exam performed at a Veterans (VA) health system site is NOT eligible secondary to insurance limitations and VA Radiologist affiliation with Yale Radiology.
3. Second reads for imaging exams on in-patients at other YNHHS hospitals (ex. Bridgeport, Greenwich etc) while they are still hospitalized at the other site are not eligible.

---

To request an outside read:

Best Method:
1. Upload the exam via Powershare software (available on every clinical workstation) and choose nominate for second read/official interpretation option. Powershare can receive images electronically from many other institutions or pull images from CD-ROM.
2. Carefully complete the patient clinical details and requesting MD's contact information.
3. Co-sign the request for the imaging order in your Epic In-basket.
4. Only request an outside read for the most recent examinations. Example - if your patient has multiple CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis exams and PET-CTs, only request most recent exam for official read. Older exams should still be uploaded but will be used for comparison when interpreting most recent study.

---

Alternative Methods:
1. Disc may be dropped off at the Image Library for upload. An order can be placed via paper form with Image Library.
2. For images already uploaded into our PACS (can be seen in patient imaging tab in EPIC) that are in an OSF status, an outside read request can also be made via EPIC by typing ""outside"" in the EPIC order search bar and selecting the correct study type. Request can also be sent via email to the Image Library team at radiologycustomerservice@ynhh.org. You must provide details on which exact study you are requesting an outside read on, the relevant clinical history/reason for consult, and the authorizing/ordering provider name and contact information.

Tumor board and multi-disciplinary conference cases must follow the same upload and ordering procedure as described above. Please submit these cases 2-3 days in advance of the conference.

---

Additional details:
If inadequate clinical history is available, or image quality is poor/incomplete, the radiologist has the discretion to not issue a formal report for the requested study.

Errors in entered exam information will lead to interpretation delays or cancelation. Orders placed via EPIC with no corresponding images uploaded will be canceled after 72 hours.

""Curbside consults"" will not be provided for CT, MRI or PET-CT exams that are eligible for the outside read program.

For Questions - the Image Library team can be reached at 203-688-8811. Any clarifications on policy/procedure can be directed to Dr. Regina Hooley, Vice Chair of Clinical Affairs or Dr. Jay Pahade, Vice Chair Quality and Safety.","The provided markdown content contains detailed procedural instructions, eligibility criteria, and step-by-step guidelines for requesting a formal interpretation of outside imaging studies.

CVDs with TPN infusions cannot be used for contrast injection unless TPN has been disconnected and vigorously flushed by an RN prior to the exam, before the patient leaves the floor.

NOTE: No IV medication drips should be stopped or restarted without an RN’s help. The injector should not be used with any IV that has questionable patency. If in doubt, question the radiologist or the patient’s caregivers.

PROCESS –
1. Follow Hand Hygiene Policy at all times: wash or use Purell, don gloves, and when completed, remove gloves then wash or use Purell.
2. The RN must access and de-access all indwelling ports. (CVD lumen access may be performed by the technologist to inject contrast.)
3. Prior to use, all CVAD lines used for contrast—whether with an injector or hand injection—must undergo a 15-second hub scrub with an approved disinfectant and be allowed to air dry (minimum 15 seconds). All CVD’s must be checked for patency and blood return using a 10 cc saline syringe (with 3 cc removed) and flushed with 10 cc sterile saline thereafter. A CVD should not be used without verification of blood return.
4. The technologist should monitor the injection site for the duration of the injection when possible.
5. The contrast for all CVD’s is Omnipaque 350. If there is a prior contrast reaction to Omnipaque, an alternative agent such as Isovue 370 may be used.

SCRIPT –

Adult Power Hickman – In-Patients:
• Call the floor to check IV status. If the RN indicates the patient has a Hickman, ask the following:
   1. Is the Hickman a Power Hickman? (Check for labeling on the clamp, a “P” or “X” on the line seen on the chest X-ray, or documentation in EPIC.)
   2. Has there been TPN running?
      - If YES: Flush vigorously immediately and disconnect the TPN, clearly marking the lumen used for TPN.
      - Send the patient with no medications running (an open flush is allowed).
      - Instruct the RN that the patient will return without the catheter being flushed with heparin.
      - If the TPN cannot be stopped and flushed before leaving the floor, the Hickman may not be used for contrast injection.
      - Follow a 15-second hub scrub and allow it to air dry (minimum 15 seconds).
      - Do not disconnect the injector prior to exam completion, or the hub scrub will need to be repeated.
      - The maximum flow rate will be listed on the lumen clamp.

Power Hickman – Outpatients:
• Follow a 15-second hub scrub and allow it to air dry (minimum 15 seconds). The maximum flow rate is as noted on the lumen clamp.
• Do not disconnect the injector prior to exam completion; instead, call the South Pavilion Core IR RN, Prep Hold RN, or the RN in your respective area to flush heparin post-injection per YNHH policy.

Injection Rate for Pediatric Peripheral IV Injections (for neck/foot veins):

| Lumen Size           | Max Flow Rate  | PSI  |
|----------------------|----------------|------|
| 18g, 20g IV access   | 5 cc/sec       | 150  |
| 22g IV access        | 3 cc/sec       | 150  |
| 24g IV access        | 1.5 cc/sec     | 50   |

PEDIATRIC CENTRAL LINES INCLUDING BROVIAC
• Only pediatric central lines that are 4 French (approximately 24G) or larger should be used for contrast injections. (Note: A higher gauge number indicates a smaller line; a lower gauge number indicates a larger line.)
• Many neonate PICC lines are between 1.5-3F and are at high risk of being damaged by a contrast injection; they should not be used unless approved by the radiologist and the ordering attending provider.
• For inpatients: Call the RN and instruct them to accompany the patient. The pediatric RN will follow YNHH hub scrub policy, access the central line, and then the technologist will connect the contrast. Omnipaque 350 may be injected at 1 cc/sec at 100 PSI.
• For outpatients with a Broviac: Call Out Patient Pediatric Nursing and follow the same process as for inpatients.

IALERT!
Attention all technologists who inject contrast: If you see a Pall Positive ELD filter or a Baxter INTERLINE System Extension Set (air eliminating filter) connected to a patient, stop the line and notify a nurse immediately. These filters are used for patients with a patent foramen ovale, as any introduced air could cause a serious reaction. They should NEVER be used with a power injector.

NOTE: EMERGENT AND LIFE-SAVING CARE SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED DUE TO RADIATION PRECAUTIONS.

---

General Radiation Safety
The two basic concepts related to ionizing radiation are defined as follows:
• Exposure – the energy given off by a radioactive material.
• Contamination – the presence of radioactive material on a person or item.

Contamination control is the primary concern for healthcare staff interacting with radiopharmaceutical therapy patients. The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper handling of contaminated waste are essential to protect staff and prevent the spread of contamination. Standard PPE (gloves, shoe covers, gown) is recommended, with double gloving advised for handling contaminated body fluids.

Although exposure risk to staff from these patients is low, any necessary countermeasures will follow the principles of time, distance, and shielding, or be determined by the radiation safety office.

---

Pluvicto (Lu-177 vipivotide tetraxetan)
PLUVICTO™ (lutetium Lu-177 vipivotide tetraxetan) is used to treat adults with prostate cancer. The treatment is administered every 6 weeks and is excreted through the kidneys, with detectable radiation present in bodily fluids (urine, saliva, emesis, blood, etc.) for several days.

Precautions for 7 days post-treatment:
• Use universal precautions in all patient interactions and when handling blood and bodily fluids.
• Patient excreta (urine, stool, emesis) may be safely flushed down toilets (flush twice to ensure complete emptying).
• Collect items used for excreta in a dedicated waste bin to avoid mixing with ordinary waste.
• For patients with urinary catheters or drainage bags, empty and flush the urine but discard the drainage bag as radiation waste in a dedicated container.
• Seal and label any collected bodily fluids (eg, from paracentesis) as ""Hold for Radiation Safety Department"" and store them separately from standard waste streams.
• Contact the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine department for disposal instructions.
• Ensure the treatment room is held until it is cleared by the radiation safety office or nuclear medicine for reuse.

Radiation Safety Department Contact information is repeated for various hospitals. In emergencies, contact the patient’s attending oncologist (Dr. Petrylak, Kim, Hurwitz) or the on-call provider immediately.

---

Lutathera (Lu-177 dotatate)
LUTATHERA® (lutetium Lu-177 dotatate) is indicated for adults with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) that express the somatostatin receptor. The treatment is given every 8 weeks, with excretion via the kidneys, and radioactive material present in excreta for several days post-infusion.

Precautions for 7 days post-treatment:
• Use universal precautions for all patient interactions and when handling bodily fluids.
• Flush patient excreta (urine, stool, emesis) down toilets (flush twice to ensure complete emptying).
• Place items used for excreta collection in a dedicated waste bin.
• Secure any collected bodily fluids in a sealed container, label it as ""Hold for Radiation Safety Department,"" and store it separately from standard waste.
• Contact the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine department for disposal instructions.
• Hold the treatment room until clearance is obtained from the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine.

Again, contact details for the Radiation Safety Department are provided and in urgent cases, the patient’s attending oncologist or on-call provider should be contacted.

---

Radioactive lodine (I-131 Sodium lodide)
Radioactive lodine (often called RAI) is commonly used in the treatment of thyroid diseases, including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Although RAI is usually a single administration, multiple doses may be necessary, and radioactive material can be detected in patient excreta (urine, saliva, sweat) for several days.

Precautions for 7 days post-treatment:
• If possible, place the patient in a single room with a dedicated bathroom.
• Use appropriate PPE (gown, gloves, shoe covers) for all patient interactions.
• Dispose of PPE in designated waste bins.
• Flush patient excreta down toilets (flush twice to ensure complete emptying).
• Place items used for collection of excreta in a dedicated waste bin.
• Contact the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine department for disposal instructions.
• Hold the treatment room until clearance is given by the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine.

Multiple radiological and medical physics societies are now recommending the discontinuation of routine lead shield placement over a patient's pelvis during diagnostic x-rays to ""protect"" the gonads.
---
Background:
Gonadal shielding is a practice that started nearly 70 years ago to offer theoretical protection to the gonadal organs during routine x-rays. No scientific evidence exists that these shields provide value or that radiation exposure to the gonads during routine radiological x-rays performed today causes increased risk of heritable defects to the gonads. Data actually shows that radiation dose to the gonads may be INCREASED when a lead shield is used as it can increase the radiation emitted by the x-ray machine. Additionally, if the shield is not properly placed it can result in having to repeat a radiograph, thereby doubling patient radiation exposure. Yale New Haven Radiology ceased routine use of pelvis/gonadal shields during the COVID pandemic to reduce fomite risks associated with shields.
---
Assessment:
Several radiology and medical physics societies (both in the US and globally) have issued formal policies that recommend abandoning the routine use of gonadal shielding for radiographs taken in a radiology department using proper technique. Many large health networks across the US have already transitioned away from routine use of lead shields over the pelvis. Radiation safety experts at Yale New Haven Health have also agreed that this transition makes sense and is worthwhile. Other lead shields for different body parts (breast, thyroid) used for select radiology procedures are NOT affected by this policy change. Gonadal shield use during fluoroscopic exams (when needed) is also not affected by this change.
---
Recommendation:
Routine use of gonadal shields during diagnostic radiographs is no longer recommended. Radiology staff will continue to adhere to the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) policy of radiation safety by using imaging techniques that impart the lowest possible amount of radiation to create diagnostic quality images. A patient informational sheet explaining this change has been created and will be available to patients at all Yale New Haven Radiology sites soon. Adoption of this policy at other YNHHS delivery network sites will occur over the next 6-12 months. Any patient or parent that still feels strongly in having a shield provided for their exam can ask the xray technologist for one. We won't refuse shielding a patient who requests it.","The document contains actual policy text detailing the discontinuation of routine gonadal shield use during diagnostic x-rays, along with background information, an assessment of current practices and policies, and a clear recommendation.

Date Approved: October 2019 | Approved by: Formulary Integration Committee (FIC) and System Clinical Council
Date Reviewed/Revised: Sept 2020
Distribution: MCN Policy Manager | System Policy Type (I or II): I

---
PURPOSE
To provide guidance for inpatients to safely self-manage their own care using Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pump (CSII or Insulin Pump) and/or Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems.

---
APPLICABILITY
This policy applies to each licensed hospital affiliated with Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), including Bridgeport Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, Westerly Hospital, Yale New Haven Hospital and any other hospital that may affiliate with YNHHS.

---
DEFINITIONS
CSII / Insulin pump: An external continuous infusion device used to deliver a constant infusion of rapid-acting insulin (pre-set basal insulin rates) and patient-delivered pre-meal boluses and correction boluses to manage glycemic control.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems: Use a small ""sensor"" inserted subcutaneously to continuously measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid. The sensor transmits results to a ""receiver"" (which may be a smart phone), displaying real-time glucose levels and glycemic trends.

Automated Insulin Delivery Insulin Pump system: Interfaced with a CGM, it adjusts basal insulin delivery based on glucose trajectories and values. Note that patients will still need to bolus for carbohydrate intake and may require correction doses.

• Low suspend and predictive low glucose suspend systems (e.g., t:slim X2™ with Basal-IQ™, Medtronic 530G, Medtronic 630G): Interrupt basal insulin delivery in response to low or predicted low sensor glucose values.
• Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) insulin pumps (e.g., Medtronic 670G, t:sim X2™ with Control-IQ™): Capable of both increasing and reducing basal insulin delivery based on sensor values.

---
POLICY
A. The admitting provider evaluates if the patient or identified caregiver (e.g., significant other, parent, guardian) is capable of self-management of the insulin pump and/or CGM system.

B. The patient’s insulin pump settings (e.g., basal-bolus settings) may require adjustment during hospitalization to minimize hyper- and hypoglycemia due to factors such as:
   a. Stress of illness, infection, surgery
   b. Alterations in carbohydrate intake
   c. Enteral or parenteral nutrition
   d. Administration of medications that affect glycemic control (e.g., steroids, pressors, octreotide, etc.)

C. Adjustments to the insulin pump settings are ordered by the provider.

D. The patient maintains and adjusts the pump settings per provider order.

E. For planned surgeries, the anesthesiologist and patient collaborate regarding insulin pump and/or CGM management during the perioperative period.

F. Although CGM is not FDA-approved for guiding inpatient therapy, when paired with an insulin pump it may be useful for patient self-care.

---
PROCEDURE
*Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII / Insulin) Pump*
1. Verify that the patient wishes to continue using their insulin pump during the hospital stay and is able to self-manage.
2. Confirm the patient’s (or caregiver’s) ability to manage the pump, ensuring they are:
   a. Fully alert and oriented
   b. Possess adequate manual dexterity
   c. Have sufficient visual acuity
   d. Possess ready access to patient-supplied pump supplies (provided from home)
   e. Have signed an agreement for insulin pump management (to be filed in the medical record and provided to the patient)
3. Assess for potential contraindications such as cognitive or physical impairments, behavioral concerns, lack of supplies, medical conditions (e.g., DKA, critical illness), or pump malfunction.
4. Inform the patient that the health care team reserves the right to remove the pump if self-management becomes unsafe.
5. Establish an alternative insulin replacement plan (e.g., Basal-Bolus-Correction regimen or insulin infusion order) in case the pump is discontinued.
6. Nursing must confirm that patient-supplied pump supplies are available for the duration of the stay (the hospital does not stock these supplies).
7. The pharmacist will verify the availability of patient-supplied insulin vial(s) per the YNHHS policy; if unavailable, a vial may be ordered.
8. Nursing verifies that a provider order exists in the patient’s record for pump use, including details such as:
   a. Continuation of current basal rates and settings
   b. Clinician contact information
   c. Manufacturer details
   d. Insulin type, brand, concentration, basal rates, bolus parameters, target blood glucose ranges, and infusion site change guidelines (at least every 72 hours, or sooner if indicated)
9. Diet orders for consistent carbohydrate intake and appropriate consultations (Endocrinology, Diabetes CDE, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist) should be made.
10. Document the pump’s presence and the last infusion set/site change on admission.
11. Communicate point-of-care (POC) glucose readings and document patient-administered doses in real time in the MAR.
12. Assess and document the infusion site for signs of inflammation or infection every shift.
13. Notify the provider if:
   a. Blood glucose targets are not met
   b. There are concerns with the patient’s ability to self-manage
   c. The patient cannot change the infusion set due to lack of supplies
14. Notify the Radiology Department for patients scheduled for radiological procedures (x-ray/fluoroscopy, CT, or MRI), and if required:
   a. Order the removal of the insulin pump before the procedure (with specific instructions based on procedure duration)
   b. Ensure the pump is kept outside the imaging room
   c. Remove infusion sets with metal cannulas before MRI
15. If the pump is discontinued due to patient inability or critical illness:
   a. Initiate alternate insulin therapy (SC or infusion) immediately
   b. Disconnect the pump
   c. Secure the pump per facility policy or send it home with a designated family member/guardian

*Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System*
1. Confirm the patient’s (or caregiver’s) ability and understanding to use CGM in the hospital, ensuring that:
   a. The patient is fully alert and oriented
   b. Treatment decisions rely on hospital POC blood glucose meter results (since CGM is not FDA-approved for inpatient management)
   c. CGM results are for patient information only
   d. The patient has the manual dexterity needed to operate the device
   e. Hospital POC results may be used for necessary calibrations
   f. A signed agreement for CGM monitoring is obtained and documented
2. Nurse confirms that patient-supplied CGM supplies are available (the hospital does not stock these supplies).
3. Assess the CGM insertion site every shift and document findings in the EMR.
4. Notify the Radiology Department if the patient is scheduled for procedures; ensure CGM removal as per manufacturer guidelines (see Appendix).
5. Arrange consultations (Endocrinology, Diabetes CDE, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist) as applicable.
6. If CGM must be removed due to procedures or supply issues:
   a. Remove the sensor and transmitter
   b. Secure the CGM components with staff or send them home with a designated family member/guardian

*Automated Insulin Delivery Insulin Infusion Pump*
1. Automatic Mode (algorithm-regulated basal rates) may not be suitable in all circumstances. The admitting provider must assess appropriateness and note this in the insulin pump order set:
   a. At YNH (YSC and SRC), consult an Endocrinologist, Endocrine Fellow, or Diabetes Team APRN
   b. At other networks, consult the patient’s insulin pump prescriber if uncertain
2. Contraindications for automatic mode include, but are not limited to:
   a. High-dose steroid therapy
   b. DKA, HHS, or other critical illnesses
   c. Lack of sensor supplies
   d. Sensor malfunctions
   e. Provider discretion

APPENDIX
The insulin pump or CGM system is to be removed before any radiological procedure involving x‐ray/fluoroscopy, CT scanning, or MRI unless the device manufacturer provides information supporting safe use. If the device cannot be temporarily stopped, evaluate the risks and benefits as outlined below.

Insulin Pump and CGM Systems during X‐ray exams, CT Scans, and MRI:
• The presence of an insulin pump or glucose monitor should not preclude medically indicated CT or X‐ray imaging, but the device should be removed whenever possible.
• The probability that x‐ray or CT scan irradiation causes a device malfunction or adverse event is extremely low, especially if the device is not located in the region being imaged.
• No known adverse events during CT imaging of insulin pumps or glucose monitors have been reported. Although other electronic devices (e.g., cardiac implantable devices, neurostimulators) have had adverse events, there is little evidence that CT irradiation was the direct cause.

# PURPOSE

To provide guidelines for the use of intravenous or oral, iodinated and gadolinium based contrast media, as well as the proper response of Radiology staff in the event of a contrast media event.

## RESPONSIBILITY

1. IV and oral contrast media agents are considered medications under Joint Commission standards; all applicable YNHH drug use policies apply.
2. The patient’s physician, PA, or APRN orders radiology exams (including those requiring contrast) via written requisition or computer order entry. Inpatient and ED requests must include information such as pregnancy status and renal function as appropriate.
3. The radiologist is primarily responsible for reviewing the patient’s history (including eGFR levels when applicable) and ensuring the appropriateness of contrast use, with the dose and agent typically pre-assigned per protocol.
4. For CT exams ordered with IV contrast, only radiology physicians and/or advanced practitioners (or autoprotocol-eligible exams) may protocol the study. In these exams the patient’s eGFR should be ≥ 30. If eGFR is < 30, the following workflow applies:
   a. Inpatients and ED patients must have eGFR results within 48 hours, unless the exam qualifies for bypass.
   b. Outpatients who answer ""Yes"" to a renal risk factor question on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire require renal function assessment. If no eGFR is available within 6 weeks in Epic, a Point of Care (POC) eGFR test is provided, and levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist.
5. All personnel involved in administering contrast media must know the procedures to anticipate, prevent, recognize, and respond to contrast reactions (see Addendum 1.15A Recognition and Response to Contrast Reaction).

---

# 6. eGFR Workflow and Responsibilities for CT

a. For CT studies ordered WITH contrast and with eGFR over 30, the exam can proceed with IV contrast.

b. For CT studies with a Life/Limb Threatening priority (e.g., full trauma or stroke code), eGFR testing is not required prior to imaging.

c. For CT studies WITH contrast and eGFR below 30 upon patient arrival:
   i. The technologist contacts the appropriate reading room so a radiologist can review the case and decide whether to:
      1. Proceed with contrast despite eGFR < 30 (after discussion with the ordering provider and documenting the reasoning),
      2. Change the exam to CT WITHOUT contrast (with documentation and specific actions such as placing a 52 Modifier and emailing rationale), or
      3. Cancel/reschedule the exam (with the cancellation reason noted in Epic by the Clinical Scheduling Assistant).
   ii. The radiologist’s decision is documented in the Epic study notes.
   iii. If changes or cancellations occur, the CSA communicates with the ordering physician’s office using an approved script; if disagreement arises, the radiologist’s decision prevails.

---

# PROCEDURE GUIDELINES FOR INTRAVENOUS (IV) CONTRAST

1. IV contrast is administered through an established IV line (by a nurse or technologist). (Refer to DR Policy Medication Administration by Technologists in Diagnostic Radiology.)

2. Before IV contrast administration, the patient’s history—including medications, allergies, and renal impairment screening—is reviewed via the medical record or outpatient questionnaire:
   a. If no contraindications are present, proceed per the radiologist’s protocol.
   b. If contraindications exist, the case is referred to the radiologist.
   c. The IV line is maintained during the exam in case IV drug therapy becomes necessary.
   d. A physician, APP, or RN must be on site during contrast administration.
   e. A contrast reaction kit and emergency equipment (e.g., a code cart at hospital sites) must be immediately available.

3. Point of Care (POC) testing is performed by technologists or nursing staff to measure creatinine (and calculate eGFR) to assess renal function.

4. The POC meter is maintained by the MRI and CT scan departments under a strict QA schedule that includes staff training and annual competency reviews by the Department of Laboratory Medicine.

5. For POC Renal Function Testing in Radiology:
   a. MRI Patients: See the MRI safety manual for details.
   b. CT Patients: Outpatients answering ""Yes"" to contrast-related questions on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire receive POC testing if no eGFR/Cr value is available within 6 weeks, with eGFR levels under 30 being referred to the radiologist.

---

# For Planned Administration of Contrast Agents:

Previous reaction to allergens (e.g., shellfish, peanuts, medications):

Mild | Moderate | Severe
--- | --- | ---
None | None | None

Previous reaction to the same class of contrast agent planned to be given:

Mild | Moderate | Severe
--- | --- | ---
None | Pre-medicate and use a different agent | Do not give contrast*

Previous reaction to a different class of contrast agent than the one planned:

Mild | Moderate | Severe
--- | --- | ---
None | None | None

*Unless, in the opinion of the responsible health care professional and supervising radiologist, the benefits outweigh the risks (e.g., in emergency situations). In such cases, the clinical provider should accompany the patient to the radiology suite to manage any repeat reaction.

Premedication with steroids and Benadryl is now recommended only for patients with a prior reaction to the same class of contrast agent (iodinated for CT and gadolinium-based for MRI). Prophylaxis for reactions to other allergens is no longer necessary.

Evidence supporting these guidelines includes:
- An estimated overall reaction risk of <1% (approximately 0.2–0.6%) (Wang et al., Dillman et al.).
- Patients with a prior reaction face a 3–11% overall reaction rate and a 2% breakthrough reaction rate despite pre-medication during CT (Mervak et al., Lasser et al.).
- An IV steroid regimen (detailed below) is considered non-inferior to a longer oral regimen and is recommended in ED and in-patient settings to expedite imaging (Mervak et al.).

---

# Exclusions

In certain clinical circumstances, the urgency of a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI may override the benefits of fully executing the premedication protocol. In these cases, contrast may be administered without premedication or with a modified protocol. Such decisions should be made jointly by the supervising radiologist and the ordering clinician (and the patient, if feasible), with appropriate documentation in the medical record.

## Allergic Like Reaction Definitions [1]:

Mild             | Moderate                     | Severe
:---------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:
Limited urticaria/pruritis [2] | Diffuse urticaria/pruritis | Diffuse edema, or facial edema with dyspnea
Nasal congestion | Diffuse erythema with stable vital signs | Diffuse erythema with hypotension
Cutaneous edema  | Facial edema without dyspnea  | Laryngeal edema with stridor and/or hypoxia
Sneezing/conjunctivitis/rhinorrhea | Throat tightness or hoarseness without dyspnea | Wheezing/bronchospasm with significant hypoxia
Limited ""itchy""/""scratchy"" throat | Wheezing/bronchospasm with mild or no hypoxia | Anaphylactic shock (hypotension + tachycardia)

[^0]
[^0]: [1] Physiologic reactions such as nausea, vomiting, or a feeling of warmth are unlikely to benefit from pre-medication. [2] If urticaria/pruritis required medical treatment, it should be considered moderate in severity.

B. Scope
This SOP applies to all faculty who have clinical home workstations (HWS) and are able to read cases/perform routine clinical duties remotely.
---
C. Materials
None
---
D. Procedure
1. WFH shifts should be limited during the normal working day (8a to 5p) and any staggered shifts.
   - Fewer than 50% of faculty (approximately) should be scheduled to work from home during the standard weekday.
     - This may be increased when social distancing requirements are not possible in existing reading room environments or other special circumstances, under the approval of the Chair/VC Clinical Affairs.
   - Attending/trainee onsite ratio should be approximately 50/50.
   - Additional faculty may work from home during Code-D situations only after approval by the Section Chief/Chair/VC Clinical Affairs.
2. WFH shifts are PINK color coded in Ogenda.
   - WFH shifts should be rotated amongst faculty to ensure a routine regular onsite presence.
3. WFH trainee interaction/teaching is encouraged using Primordial, Zoom or other HIPAA compliant electronic communications/sharing applications approved by YNHH IT.
4. WFH shifts will not require higher RVU generation (or longer hours) than on-site shifts and should be considered equal.
5. Emergent on-site presence may be required during a WFH shift in the event of equipment failure or other urgent situation determined by the Section Chief/Chair/VC Clinical Affairs.

Title: Time off Clinical service for Grant Funded research on CES track
Prepared By: David C. Madoff
Management Approval: Rob Goodman, MD | Date: January 2022
---
1.0 Purpose
This SOP is intended to define how grant funded research % effort is applied to clinical effort for clinician scientists who are on the CES track.

Scope
Faculty may be awarded research % effort as part of individual or collaborative grant awards. This research effort may be used to reduce clinical % effort. Clinical faculty on scholarly tracks already receive dedicated academic time but may need increased academic time due to funding success. This SOP applies to both selfinitiated and industry grants and is beyond the prescriptive level provided by training grants (e.g., NIH K-award, Doris Duke Charitable Funding, YCCI etc.) to which the award rules will apply.

Materials
None

4.0 Procedures:
4.1. If a faculty member secures grant funding % effort, this may be used in conjunction with departmentally funded % non-clinical effort.

4.2. CES Track with grant funded research:
Any grant funded % effort above 10% will be applied towards a reduction in clinical % effort. Due to the need for a minimum level of clinical activity, no faculty member on the CES track will be able to have less than 50% clinical effort.

4.2.1. For example:
- If a CES track faculty member (with 20% departmentally funded nonclinical effort) receives 10% research effort, their clinical % effort will be unchanged.
- If a CES track faculty member (with 20% departmentally funded nonclinical effort) receives 15% research effort, their clinical effort will be reduced by an additional 5%.

4.2.2. Multiple small grants held by a single faculty member may be additive.
- Example: Five 3% grants may be equivalent to a single 15% grant. Their clinical effort would be reduced by 5%.

4.3. CES Track with independent PI grant funded research:
Any grant funded % effort will be applied towards a reduction in clinical % effort in addition to the Departmental 20% non-clinical effort. Due to the need for a minimum level of clinical activity, no faculty member on the CES/CS track with nontraining grant funding should have less than 50% clinical effort.

4.3.1. For example:
- If a CES track faculty member (with 20% departmentally funded nonclinical effort) receives 10% research effort as a PI from an RO1, their clinical % effort will be reduced by an additional 10%.

4.3.2. Multiple small grants held by a single faculty member may be additive.
- Example: (5) 3% grants may be equivalent to a single 15% grant. Their clinical effort will be reduced by an additional 15%.

Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS) has implemented a new practice in which lead aprons are no longer used on patients undergoing routine X-ray exams. This change is based on confidence in safety protocols and aligns with the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle. X-ray technologists will use the lowest amount of radiation necessary to produce quality images.

Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the Department of Radiology's process for inclement weather and other unforeseen operational circumstances requiring radiology services to be suspended. In these instances, our top priority is to continue to provide excellent and accessible patient care while maintaining the safety of our radiologists.

---

B. Scope

a. The SOP applies to YNHH and BH radiology inpatient and outpatient sites.
b. There will inevitably be occasions when clinical operations are curtailed due to unforeseen circumstances, such as snowstorms, hurricanes and other unpredictable events. During these times, clinical radiology activity will be reduced.

---

C. Procedures

a. The VC for Clinical Affairs will communicate YNHH/BH operational changes to faculty and trainees.
b. Faculty should be flexible depending on conditions. The goal is to staff to demand.
c. An appropriate number of faculty should work from home whenever possible.
d. Expected coverage and appropriate staffing is the responsibility of the division/section chiefs, depending on the situation and expected reduced caseload. Minimal staffing guidelines may revert to a weekend staffing model or other curtailed staffing model.

Guide to Minimum Coverage, if a weekend staffing model is not used*

| Division/Section | # Faculty* | Comments |

| IR               | Variable   | |
| MSK              | 1          | |
| Neuro            | 3-4        | 4 needed on M/TH/F |
| Nuc Med          | 1          | |
| Peds             | 1          | |

* If additional staffing is required, it should be approved by the Chair or VC Clinical Affairs
** All faculty should be WFH whenever possible, as determined by their Division/Section Chief

e. Radiologist staffing should mirror closures of staffed outpatient facilities i.e. if an ambulatory center is closed, the radiologist scheduled for that site would no longer be required. In the unusual situation where an outpatient site is maintained open, appropriate remote and/or on-site staffing should be arranged in addition to the above. Note that there may be outpatient procedures at YNHH, SRC and SMC, although usually limited.

f. Decisions as to whether radiologists are required in-house will be made by the Section Chief. This decision may be based on safety (distance needed to travel/type of car) and those most willing to work. On occasion, the person listed on-call may be responsible for in-house coverage.

g. Faculty not working on those days will be deemed to be on an academic day. They will not lose claim to PTO due to this mandated absence from the clinical schedule. If necessary, a ""snow day make up slot"" may be added to the clinical schedule if approved by the Chair or VC for Clinical Affairs.

h. Resident coverage needed will be decided by the Section Chiefs. Which residents come in should be determined by the Chief Residents. For the residents who do not come in, that day will not be counted as a vacation day.

i. Multi-day storms and other rare scenarios may require coverage adjustment.

j. If a storm is less severe than predicted, faculty may be required to come in despite an earlier cancellation of services.

k. YNHH may provide in-house boarding for faculty who need to stay overnight. If faculty need to book lodging elsewhere, they should get prior approval by YDR administration and use hotels offering Yale discounts.

REVISED 1/17/2020
AVITABLE, JOHN

Downtime Report Resolution Procedure

The purpose of this document is to set the expectation for what the Clinical Imaging Technology team's responsibilities are in the event of a planned Epic downtime resulting in temporary accessions being generated.

• Preliminary Tasks
  1. Determine relevant staff that will be working during Downtime.
     a. Go to [amion.com](http://amion.com) to find YSC and SRC on-call Resident and Radiologist.
        - Attending Schedule: can be found on [yalerad.qgenda.com](http://yalerad.qgenda.com)
     b. Eileana Valentin (Eileana.Valentin@bpthosp.org) is the contact for BH residency at this time.
     c. GH uses Nighthawk Telerad service for overnight ED exams which are faxed in and are thus unaffected by an Epic downtime.
  2. Email the relevant staff to remind them of the downtime. You may wish to include a phone number that you can be reached at if any issues are encountered.

• 2:00AM - Downtime Begins

Orders for imaging exams will be written on paper. These paper orders will have a sticker placed on them with the Downtime/Temporary Accession number. When performing these exams, technologists will track the exams that they perform on a log sheet. The log sheet should include: Patient Name, MRN, Exam Type, Exam Date and Time, Temporary Accession, and Epic Accession.

While the technologists are performing exams and recording information on the logs, Radiologists are dictating in PowerScribe on temporary accessions. Radiologists may include additional information in their report such as Patient Name and MRN, though they are not required to do so.

• 6:00AM - Downtime Ends

After the downtime ends, you will receive notification from Production Control that the downtime activities have been completed successfully. Once the Production system comes back up, the Technologists will begin placing, scheduling, and completing the orders that were placed on paper during the downtime.

Once all orders are placed, and their Epic accession numbers noted, the log will be sent to DITraining@ynhh.org along with contact information for the individual who submitted the log.

• Associating Temporary Accessions with Epic Accessions

Once you receive logs, you can begin associating temporary accessions with Epic accessions. No temporary accession will be associated without proper documentation. You should not have to do additional research or make judgment calls to decide whether or where a temporary accession should be associated. If there are any questions, contact the person who sent the log.

To associate Temporary Accessions, log in to the PowerScribe webportal and search for all temporary accessions created in the past 24 hours.

| Site      |     | Order Status |     | Patient Class |     | Account |     |   |
| :--:      | :--: | :--:       | :--: | :--:       | :--: | :--:   | :--: | :--: |
| All       | ✓   | Temporary  | ✓   | All         | ✓   | All    | ✓   |     |
| Locking   |     | Report Status |   | Section   |     | Ordering Physician |     |   |
| All       | ✓   | All        | ✓   |           | ✓   | All    |     |   |
| Time Frame| Custown | Transfer Status |   | Location |   |        | Reset | Search 4 |

A list of search results will appear which should include all of the temporary accessions that were created during the downtime, as well as other accessions that do not need to be addressed. You will only be associating temporary accessions that have been appropriately documented on the log. Different sites may prefix their temporary accession numbers to denote the originating location. Accessions that include a patient's name should be disregarded.

From the search results screen, click the Actions link on the right of the screen and select the Associate option. After clicking Associate, you will have the option to add or replace the order. Select the Replace option. Then search for the Epic accession number and complete the association. Once completed, the system will wait 3 minutes and send the report to Epic; alternatively, you can force the report to send immediately.

![img-0.jpeg](images/img-0.jpeg.png)

After sending the report to Epic, confirm that it appears appropriately and was transmitted through the interface. There may be issues with interfaces on both the Epic and PowerScribe sides, especially during a downtime.

• 7:00AM - Status Report

At 7:00AM, you should begin receiving downtime logs. Send a status report that includes information about who has sent logs, at what time, and what is still pending. This email should be sent to:

• YDR Administrators
• YDR Section Chiefs
• YSC ED Overnight Staff
• YNHH Radiology Management
• BH Radiology Management
• Matthew Zawalich and Heather Hogle

• Follow-Up Status Report

After sending the initial status report and continuing to associate temporary accessions as they are received, send another email updating key staff on the progress made. This follow-up email generally goes to management only (excluding the radiologists/YDR Section Chiefs).

In this follow-up email, reference any issues encountered, difficulties in obtaining necessary information, and note successes (such as a location providing timely logs).

• Final Status Report

Once all temporary accessions have been associated with the appropriate Epic accession numbers, send a final summary email to all parties, including the radiologists (YDR Section Chiefs), confirming that all temporary accessions have been appropriately associated and verified in Epic.

• Deleting Temporary Accessions

As a final task, delete the temporary accessions that have been associated. This is a lower priority task and can be completed after other tasks have been finished.

A. Yale University encourages its faculty to participate in clinical care, sponsored research, consulting, teaching, and other activities that may be beneficial to both the individual faculty member and the University.

B. External professional activities should not interfere nor impede the ability of a faculty member to fulfill the primary responsibilities of their Yale appointment or conflict with University institutional goals and policies for MCIC professional liability insurance coverage. For this reason, faculty are discouraged from participation in outside clinical professional activity (i.e., moonlighting activities).

""Moonlighting"" is any professional and/or independent patient care activity, in all forms of delivery (including telemedicine consultations, e-consults or other similar modalities, and independently negotiated sessions/hours at Yale Health) that is outside a provider's commitment to a YSM site of practice, clinical services agreement, or where a YSM entity does not receive payment or bill for professional services.

2. These guidelines apply to all clinical employees of Yale School of Medicine (YSM) who are rostered with MCIC for professional liability insurance coverage, which includes faculty physicians with an appointment at YSM (even if they may receive partial funding from Yale New Haven Health) and non-physician clinical staff (advanced practice providers, etc). Please refer to the External Professional Activities Guidance webpage for guidelines for professional activities faculty members engage in outside of their Yale responsibilities, https://provost.yale.edu/policies/external-professional-activities-guidance.

3. Only outside clinical (patient care) professional activity will be directly addressed within these guidelines. Please refer to the Yale Faculty handbook for guidelines for outside non-clinical interests and employment, https://provost.yale.edu/faculty-handbook.

4. These guidelines DO NOT apply to clinical employees or housestaff of Yale New Haven Health, YaleHealth or Yale School of Nursing who do not have a financially compensated appointment at YSM.

C. Written requests for approval are needed before engaging in outside clinical professional activities (i.e., ""moonlighting"").

5. Written requests for approval must be submitted prior to the start of outside professional work to the department Chair or designee.

6. Written approval for moonlighting activities may be granted at the discretion of the provider's department Chair or designee.

7. Departments have the option of creating a departmental policy that prohibits such activity.

D. In addition to any conditions that are stipulated by the provider's department, approval for external moonlighting opportunities must meet the following Yale University requirements:

1. Providers will not provide patient care services in any capacity of a professional or commercial nature to or for any person or institution, or engage in any other activity that would be in violation of the Yale University conflict of interest or commitment policy, http://your.yale.edu/policies- procedures/other/yale-university-policy-conflictinterest.

2. All faculty members are required annually to report their external activities and financial interests on the external disclosure form, https://ires.yale.edu/main.asp.

3. A faculty member may not accept salaried employment at another institution while a full-time employee of Yale, http://provost.yale.edu/faculty-handbook.

4. Any relationship with an outside organization that requires frequent or prolonged absence from Yale represents a conflict of commitment that must be avoided. Therefore, outside activities at another institution cannot average more than one day per seven-day week, http://provost.yale.edu/faculty-handbook.

5. Yale titles, e-mail addresses, websites, and stationery printed with Yale identification should not be used for the promotion or marketing of any outside clinical professional activities by any member of the academic community.

*All providers (MD, PA, CRNA, CNM, APRN and Clinical psychologist) need to be in the Malpractice Insurance database (MICS at Yale), or ""rostered,"" if they are providing care that needs to be covered under the Yale MCIC policy.

E. Professional Liability Coverage Insurance

1. The MCIC professional liability insurance coverage provided to Yale University serves as coverage ONLY for assigned professional activities within the scope of employment at Yale University, clinical services agreement, or training. This includes services performed on behalf of YSM and where a YSM entity performs the billing or receives the payment for clinical services.

2. The professional liability insurance coverage provided to Yale University WILL NOT COVER professional clinical activities performed outside of the scope of employment at Yale University with the primary intent of receiving supplementary income (""moonlighting"" activities mentioned in section C).

3. For Yale-employed faculty who are rostered with MCIC, the professional liability policy will generally cover professional activities outside of Yale with a clear academic and teaching context.
   a. This will include demonstrations of new techniques in clinical facilities or conference settings, volunteer work and/or international efforts in a clinical and teaching capacity, invitations to practice at another institution for teaching purposes, consultation on cases from another institution while at a professional conference, etc.
   b. Providers should be aware that they may need the appropriate licensure to provide these activities/services in the applicable jurisdiction(s) where the patient is located. Performing clinical services where the patient is located outside of the state of CT may subject the provider to legal proceedings in that jurisdiction.
   c. Additionally, MCIC professional liability insurance provided to Yale University only covers providers who are physically in CT, RI, or NY (or another state where MCIC is registered to do business) while providing clinical services on a regular and frequent basis.

4. Any activities within section E3 should also be within the provider's usual scope of practice as credentialed at Yale Medicine. ""Good Samaritan"" actions are separately covered by law.

F. For questions pertaining to these guidelines, please refer to the Appendix or contact the Yale Medicine Chief Medical Officer (203-785-7613) or the Yale University Office of General Counsel (203-432-4949).

Appendix

Will the clinical professional activity be performed on behalf as part of your commitment to a YSM site of practice, clinical services agreement, or where a YSM entity will receive payment or bill for professional services?

No

Does the outside clinical professional activity have a clear academic or teaching context (e.g., demonstrating new techniques in clinical facilities or conferences, volunteer work and/or international efforts in a clinical and teaching capacity, invitations to practice at another institution for teaching purposes, consultations on cases from another institution while at a professional conference, etc.)?

No

Is the clinical professional activity performed outside of the scope of employment at Yale University with the primary intent of receiving supplementary income (includes telemedicine consultations, e-consults or similar modalities, independently negotiated sessions/hours at Yale Health)?

Yes

This outside clinical professional activity is not considered to be ""moonlighting"" and is covered under MCIC professional liability insurance provided to Yale University.

This outside clinical professional activity is not considered to be ""moonlighting"" and is covered under MCIC professional liability insurance provided to Yale University.

However, it is recommended that the provider contact the department Chair or designee if they are unsure if the activity is a ""moonlighting"" activity and would therefore need departmental approval and professional liability insurance outside of Yale to pursue. For further questions, please contact the Yale Medicine Chief Medical Officer (203-785-7613).

This outside clinical professional activity is ""moonlighting"". Prior to engaging in this activity, a provider MUST request and receive written approval from their department Chair or designee. If approval is granted, the provider must understand that they WILL NOT be covered under MCIC professional liability insurance provided to Yale University. It will be the responsibility of the provider to obtain outside professional liability insurance for this activity.

There is variation in practice across YNHHS Radiology departments with placement of pelvic/gonadal shields during CT exams, including for pediatric and pregnant patients.

---

Background:

CT scans use ionizing radiation in order to produce diagnostic images. A common misconception by radiology and clinical team members is placing a lead shield around the patient's pelvis during a CT is protective and helps reduce radiation dose to this part of the body. Most radiation to the pelvic region during a CT scan that is not imaging the pelvis is from internal scatter radiation within the body, while a lead shield is only effective in reducing external scatter radiation (radiation from outside the patient's body).

---

Assessment:

A phantom study was conducted by the YNHHS medical physics team to measure the actual radiation dose inside the pelvis during various CT scans of the head and chest with and without a lead shield in place. This confirmed that a lead shield did NOT alter the radiation dose to the pelvis compared to measurements done without the lead shield. A lead shield may also pose some risk of harm. With fast moving CT table technology, there is a risk of getting the shield caught in the system hardware and if the lead shield is accidentally included in the field of view of the CT being acquired, it will result in increased radiation dose if automated tube current modulation is being used. During the COVID-19 pandemic infection control practices for lead shields are also critical. This takes technologist time and medical supplies to ensure each shield is thoroughly cleaned before/after patient use.

---

Recommendation:

YNHHS Radiology does not recommend routine placement of lead shields over the pelvis during any CT scans (including pediatric and pregnant patients traditionally viewed as ""higher risk""), as it does not provide measurable benefit in gonadal radiation dose reduction. The ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle should always be used with proper scan settings and limited z-axis to minimize any un-necessary radiation exposure. A pelvic lead shield can be selectively used for patients who display high levels of anxiety/concern and request one or if it helps decrease patient movement during the CT.","The document includes multiple sections outlining the situation, background, assessment, and recommendation regarding the use of pelvic/gonadal shields during CT exams.

1.0 Purpose
This SOP is intended to define how grant funded research % effort is applied to clinical effort for faculty on C-track.

---

2.0 Scope
C-track faculty may be awarded research % effort as part of individual or collaborative grant awards. This research effort may be used to reduce clinical % effort. This SOP applies to both self-initiated and industry grants.

---

3.0 Materials
None

---

4.0 Procedures:
4.1 If a faculty member secures grant funding % effort, this will be used in conjunction with departmentally funded % non-clinical effort.

4.2 C Track:
Any % effort beyond 2.5% will be applied towards a reduction in clinical % effort.

4.2.1 For example,
- If a C track faculty member (with 5% departmentally funded non-clinical effort) receives 2% research effort, their clinical % effort will be unchanged.
- If a C track faculty member (with 5% departmentally funded non-clinical effort) receives 3% research effort, their clinical effort will be reduced by 0.5%.

4.3 The first 2.5% will go to YDR to offset existing non-clinical department support.

You may notice that we no longer shield patients' reproductive organs during imaging exams.

Based on over 70 years of research, medical experts now know that the best way to keep patients safe during imaging exams is to not use shields. This is true at any age, including for those who plan to have children in the future. We know this is different from how things have been done for a long time. This pamphlet talks about why this change was made.

---

BACKGROUND

In the 1950s, medical experts had less knowledge about how the x‑ray radiation used in medical imaging affected our bodies.

One concern was that the radiation might damage cells that could be passed along to future generations. Because of this concern, lead shields were often placed over patients' reproductive organs during medical imaging exams.

We now know that the best way to safely image you is to not use shields.

The amount of radiation used in medical imaging has decreased over 95% since the 1950s. Better technology means that today's medical imaging equipment can make high quality images using only very small amounts of radiation.

Scientists found that the gonads are much less sensitive to radiation than previously thought. This is true for everyone, including children and adults who plan to have children in the future.

Shields can cover up parts of the body that your doctor needs to see. If this happens, then the exam may need to be repeated.

Shields can interfere with other dose‑saving features. X‑ray equipment includes technology that makes sure just the right amount of radiation is used for the exam. Sometimes a shield can interfere with this technology, which can actually increase the amount of radiation from the exam.","The document contains actual policy text regarding the use of shielding during imaging exams.

Effective Date: January 2023
Version: 1    (RAD Mission: Clinical)
Prepared By: Regina Hooley MD – January 2023
Approval: Rob Goodman, MD – January 2023

A. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the Department of Radiology/YDR phased retirement (PR) guidelines.

B. Scope
This SOP follows University guidelines. Phased retirement applies to eligible ladder faculty who may reduce their workload by 50% in their three years of phased retirement without an equivalent drop in income in the first two years. Electing the Faculty PR is a final decision which cannot be revoked.

C. Materials
Appendix at end of this document.

D. Procedures
1. Eligible faculty
   a. Must elect to participate between their 65th and 70th birthday
      - Faculty may begin the program as early as the January or July following their 65th birthday, but no later than July 1 following their 70th birthday.
      - Faculty should inform the Chair's office of their intent to begin the program at least 6 months in advance.
   b. Have 10 or more years of continuous service
   c. Have the following appointments: Professor or Associate Professor with tenure

2. Salary and workload
   a. At the start of phased retirement, eligible faculty would reduce their workload to 50% for up to three years—receiving 100% salary in year one, 75% of salary in year two, and 50% of salary in year three.
   b. Faculty members may retire fully after year one or two and must retire no later than the end of year three.

3. Clinical Schedule
   a. Faculty in PR, in coordination with the Chair's office and division/section chief, may choose to retain their regular workload for half the year and take the other 6 months completely off.
   b. Alternatively, faculty may reduce their workload by 50% over the course of the year.
      - The exact clinical schedule should be decided in co-ordination with the Chair's office and division/section chief to avoid disrupting patient care, research, or trainee supervision for an extended period of time. PR faculty should determine their clinical schedule in advance of the academic year and should not expect to select clinical work days on a month-to-month basis.
      - PR faculty are not expected to work over the reduced clinical target.
      - If PR faculty wish to work over clinical target, they should expect to share the additional shifts equally among other faculty in their section who also wish to work over their clinical target, as per academic appointment.
      - PR faculty should enter time away in Qgenda.

4. Administrative Roles
Administrative roles may be reassigned at the discretion of the Chair. PR faculty may be asked to retain their administrative role during the 1st PR year. During the transition PR period, PR faculty are expected to serve as mentors to incoming faculty with similar administrative roles.

5. Triennial/Sabbatical Leave (TSL)
Faculty on phased retirement get one triennial leave – for the full leave period but at the salary percentage designated for that year.
   - Except for leaves granted for child care, care giving, or public service, a Triennial Leave may not be combined with any other leave, paid or unpaid, to make up a leave of absence for a full academic year.

6. Other
   a. Office space – PR faculty who request an office will be assigned office space. However, they may be asked to give up their original primary office depending on YDR demand and at the request of the Chair's office.
   b. PTO – Vacation and CME will not be tracked, and may be entered in Qgenda as vacation, CME or ""off days"".
   c. Staff account – PR faculty will be eligible for the standard YDR yearly staff account.

Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging Triennial/Sabbatical Leave of Absence (TSL) Policy for Clinical Faculty

Objectives
Provide TSL to all clinical faculty (Clinical and Clinician Educator tracts) at the Associate Professor and Full Professor rank working 100% FTE with opportunities:
1. for professional growth and development so that they may serve more effectively in their field of specialization and/or in their academic pursuits.
2. to step back from clinical duties in order to help restore/maintain energy, stamina and enthusiasm.

TSL Application and Approval Process
1. Transparent and fair
2. Supervised by the TSL Committee
3. Faculty become eligible for either sabbatical or triennial 2 years following promotion to Associate Professor.
4. Faculty are also eligible for a triennial 2.5 years from the January or July following the end of the previous TSL, or they are eligible for a sabbatical 6 years following the end of the previous TSL.
5. Eligible faculty will be notified in the fall of the year prior to the beginning of the academic year in which they will be eligible for TSL. In order to obtain Department and University approval, the completed application form must be submitted and approved by the TSL Committee and Departmental Chair before the beginning of December prior to the onset of the proposed TSL leave year.

TSL Committee
1. The Triennial/Sabbatical Leave of Absence (TSL) Committee will be a standing committee in the Yale Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging.
   a. Members will be appointed by the Departmental Chair.
   b. It will consist of a senior faculty member Chair and up to six additional faculty members representing assistant, associate and full professors within the department on both Clinical and Clinician Educator tracts.
   c. There are no set term limits, but membership (including number of members) are subject to change at the discretion of the Departmental Chair.
   d. The Committee will meet as often as necessary to fulfill the needs of the department and faculty.
2. The TSL Committee will review TSL applications to certify that an individual's leave of absence plan and amount of time requested is appropriate to meet the objectives of TSL.
3. The TSL Committee will review TSL applications with the relevant section chiefs to: (1) verify that service needs will be met during the TSL without an inordinate burden on other members of the section, and (2) ensure that prioritization and allocation is fair and appropriate, especially in the event that multiple members of a section are eligible for TSL in the same academic year.
4. Leave requests that require uninterrupted blocks of time will be prioritized over those spread out over the approval.

TSL Details
1. Leave may be requested in uninterrupted 1 month blocks of time during the single academic year within which it was approved but if this is not feasible, leave may be spread out over the approval period.
2. Faculty will not be eligible for Y-payments unless they work above their regular clinical commitment.
3. Parental leave of absence, as mandated by the University, will have priority over TSL.
4. TSL may be limited, changed, and/or postponed based on departmental and sectional clinical needs. Although the department will strive to accommodate all appropriate requests, everyone may not receive the same amount of time for TSL.

Deliverables
1. Within one month of completion of a TSL, the faculty member will provide a one-page summary to the TSL Committee that delineates how they used their TSL to meet the approved plan for their leave of absence.
2. Faculty may also be requested to meet with the TSL Committee (and possibly other invitees) to describe how their TSL helped them meet their approved leave of absence plan.

FAQs
Q. What does the faculty handbook say about TSL?
A. University guidance states the following:
   - It is a privilege and not a right.
   - It is awarded for periods up to 4 months (triennial) and up to 6 months (sabbatical).
   - It should be taken in blocks of at least 1 month.
   - For accounting purposes, TSL must be taken in the period for which it is approved (Jan thru June – for Jan 1st eligibility, July thru June – for July 1st eligibility).
   - If the applicant is unable to take the TSL in the year awarded, it may be deferred and will be given priority in the subsequent year.
   - If the applicant takes only a portion of the TSL during the year awarded, the remaining time may not roll over into subsequent years.

Q. What factors will be considered in the TSL approval process?
A. The TSL Committee will take into account the following:
   - Purpose and merits of the submitted leave of absence plan
   - Time needed to execute the plan
   - Time since previous TSL
   - Other TSLs requested concurrently within the applicant's clinical section
   - Other leaves of absence (parental, sick, administrative, phased retirement) within the applicant's clinical section
   - The amount of additional work to be covered by the applicant's colleagues during their absence.

Q. Can I augment my income during my TSL?
A. During your TSL, no additional income may be derived from working clinically through your leave. Income from TIMC, moonlighting shifts and paid call will be allowed.

Q. Does this mean that I could have decreased net income during my TSL?
A. If you augment your income with other departmental activities, you may not be able to earn this additional income during your TSL. However, you will still be eligible for your full Clinical Productivity Bonus (Clinical tract) or Academic Productivity Bonus (Clinician Educator tract), regardless of the length of your approved TSL.

Q. Is there any way to make up for lost income during my TSL?
A. Your TSL is intended to provide you with an opportunity for professional growth and development, and also to ""recharge your batteries."" Nevertheless, you may earn additional income via non-clinical work, such as medicolegal, consulting, paid lectures, writing, etc., but you must abide by conflict of interest and conflict of commitment policies.

Q. If I am on the Clinician Educator tract, how will TSL and the output from my TSL affect my Academic Productivity Bonus?
A. Clinician Educator tract faculty are eligible for the full Academic Productivity Bonus (i.e. no change in criteria or amount due to TSL). Failure to use your TSL to achieve your approved goals will not have a negative impact on your Academic Productivity Bonus. However, if you use your TSL to augment your academic output, you may be eligible for earlier promotion and for a higher bonus level according to existing departmental bonus guidelines.

Q. What will the consequences be if I fail to successfully complete my approved leave of absence plan?
A. If, after careful consideration, including an in-person meeting, the TSL Committee determines that your TSL was not appropriately used to achieve the approved objectives, the Committee may recommend that your next available TSL receive a lower priority or, in extreme circumstances, be denied.

Q. How does a TSL affect my clinical target, CME time, vacation time, and supplemental income?
A. Your clinical target, CME time and vacation time will be prorated based on the TSL time granted. The average of your %FTE for the 3 academic years prior to the date you become eligible for TSL will be used to determine the prorated number of months for your TSL. For example, if a 3 year 100% FTE is approved for full sabbatical leave, you will receive 6 months TSL, be expected to work 50% of your original target, and have 5 (instead of 10) prorated days for CME and 15 (instead of 30) prorated vacation days. You will also receive only 50% of your academic days during the remainder of the year.

Q. What happens if I am asked to work during my TSL by the Department?
A. If you are required to work during your TSL, the TSL will be deemed to have been cancelled, and your application will be deferred to the following year.

Q. How will this work if I already have approved days off of clinical service for other activities (e.g. section chief, residency activities, etc)?
A. If you usually work 100 clinical days/year and you are approved for a six months sabbatical, you would be expected to work 50 clinical days during that year.

Q. Can I take parental leave and TSL in the same academic year?
A. Yes, but every effort will be made to ensure that time off of clinical service is distributed fairly and equitably and does not place an excessive burden on other members of your section. Within reason, taking parental leave and TSL in the same academic year will be discouraged and may influence the priority that your TSL receives by the TSL Committee and section chiefs. Your TSL may be reduced or deferred accordingly, and faculty members may not have more than 6 months leave of absence (i.e. any combination of TSL and paternity leave) in any 18 month period.

Q. Are Vice Chairs eligible for TSL?
A. Applications from Vice Chairs will not be evaluated by the TSL Committee. The Departmental Chair will determine on a case by case basis whether or not a Vice Chair will get a TSL as determined by departmental needs and other considerations. If the Chair determines that a TSL is warranted for a Vice Chair, it will be coordinated with the TSL Committee and the appropriate section chief.

Q. Do Vice Chairs have priority over other faculty when applying for TSL?
A. No.

Q. Do Full Professors receive priority over Associate Professors?
A. Not necessarily. Every attempt will be made to grant TSL the first time a faculty member is eligible.

Q. What happens if I am eligible for TSL in an academic year, but it is not granted because I am not given the highest priority? Do I automatically get highest priority the next year, or is it possible that I will again receive lower priority than others and lose my TSL altogether unless the next time I am eligible?
A. A deferred TSL will be prioritized. Thus, if someone is unable to take a TSL in year 1, in most instances they will be given priority for the following academic year.

Q. What happens if there are competing requests for TSL within a clinical section?
A. Section chiefs will determine priority, time allotted, and dates for faculty requests for TSL within their section. However, these must be vetted and approved by the TSL Committee and may be subject to revision by the Committee. Any faculty member who believes that their application for TSL is not being treated fairly by a section chief can appeal to the TSL Committee.","The provided markdown content includes comprehensive policy texts.

A. Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the YDR policy for the formal interpretation and consultation of outside imaging studies (aka ""outside 2nd read requests""). The purpose of this practice is to help minimize the risk of harm to patients when clinical decisions are based on imaging findings performed outside YNHH. Performing an official consultation on outside studies also decreases additional radiation exposure and healthcare costs from repeat/duplicative exams. Institutions with similar policies have shown that a change in diagnosis occurs in approximately 8% of cases (Zan, E., Yousem, DM, et al. ""Second-opinion Consultations in Neuroradiology."" Radiology. 2010; 255(1): 135-41).

1. Formal consultation and interpretations of outside studies may be requested for CT, MRI, and PET-CT scans less than 90 days old. Outside consultation requests for exams older than 90 days may be automatically canceled by Radiology Image Library staff.
2. Un-official ""Curbside consults"" should not be provided for CT, MRI or PET exams that are eligible for an outside read.
3. Outside studies being discussed at tumor boards or other multi-disciplinary conferences must be uploaded using the process outlined above if the study is less than 90 days old.
4. Imaging performed and interpreted at other YNHHS sites (Greenwich, Bridgeport, Lawrence & Memorial, Westerly) are also ELIGIBLE for outside consultation and interpretation by Yale Radiology unless the patient is currently an in-patient at the other YNHHS site. Smilow affiliated cancer sites such as St. Francis are also eligible. Exams performed at any Bridgeport Hospital facility locations that are read by a YDR radiologist are not eligible for outside read.

---

C. Exemptions

1. Formal consultation and interpretation of outside studies is not available for ultrasound, X-ray, and nuclear medicine exams (except PET-CTs).
2. Exams from the Veterans (VA) health system are not eligible. The radiologist should dictate a sentence stating study is not eligible.
3. Requests for consultation and interpretation of outside studies that have more recent or pending relevant imaging are exempt since the older exam will only be used as a reference when interpreting the newer study. (Example: a CT spine does not have to be read if a newer MRI spine will also be read.) The radiologist should dictate a sentence stating why second read is not performed.
4. Studies performed at Bridgeport Hospital out-patient sites and Shoreline/Hamden and RCPC YNHH radiology sites are NOT eligible as those exams are interpreted by Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging radiologists.

D. Materials

See attached Tips and upload instructions (appendix).

---

E. Procedures

1. To generate a formal outside imaging interpretation (usually done by the requesting MD and/or support staff) three methods are available:
   a. Using Powershare Software
   b. Using EPIC
      - For cases where images are already uploaded in PACS.
      - In EPIC order search bar, type the word ""outside"".
      - Choose the correct Outside Interpretation order for the study you are requesting to be read and provide relevant clinical history. Imaging of the brain or spine is handled by the neuroradiology section. Imaging of the abdomen and/or pelvis is handled by the body section.
      - Orders placed via EPIC but without images uploaded into PACS within 72 hours will be canceled by file room staff. A repeat order can be placed when images become available by the ordering provider.
   c. Uploading a disc (if you do not have access to Life Image)
      - If you have a disc, you may drop it off at the Image Library (South or North Pavilion, second floor) to be uploaded.
      - Fill out the import request form provided by the Image Library Staff. Be sure to indicate on the form that you would like a secondary read.

2. Imaging will populate the appropriate radiologist worklist after being processed by Radiology File room staff. All CT Chest/abdomen/pelvis exams will be split into two accessions for an outside read CT chest and outside read CT body.
3. The patient's insurance company will be billed for the professional component fee for Yale Radiology interpretation. RVUs will be generated for each report and assigned to the billing radiologist. Interpretations will be provided within 24 hours for in-patients and 48 hours for out-patient studies once available for radiologist dictation in PACS.
4. An outside read template is required for all reports. Templates are available in Powerscribe. The following statement should be in all reports for billing purposes:
   ""This second interpretation is requested by the treating physician and the interpretation will directly contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient.""
5. Inadequate studies, cases where adequate history is not available in EPIC or the order, or cases that are not eligible for other reasons still need a dictation stating why the study will not be read.
   a. Do not dictate anything about billing the patient in your report. This will be handled by billers.
6. Patients whose cases are presented at tumor board by affiliate community Smilow Care Cancer physicians (e.g., St. Francis Smilow physicians) will not be billed.
   a. The case will not be submitted for payment by the billing department, which maintains a list of qualifying community physicians to encourage tumor board presentations without added costs. Cases presented by YNHH Smilow physicians are eligible and will be billed.

Purpose
-------
Peer learning supports a culture of learning and minimizing blame. Guiding principles are:
• All radiologists are encouraged to submit peer feedback.
• Feedback is identified by peers and brought back to individual radiologists by a peer learning leader in a respectful fashion to improve their practice.
• Peer learning opportunities are presented to sections and/or the whole department in an anonymous, non-judgmental manner focused on group learning and clinical improvement.

Goal:
The goal of peer learning is improvement of services – relying on trust and the free exchange of constructive, professional feedback. It supports daily work quality, patient safety, litigation risk reduction, and overall learning.

Definition of Peer Learning Opportunities:
Cases address actual or potential performance issues (including discrepancies and ""great calls"") and are identified during routine work, conferences, event reports, or other sources.

---

Description of Program Structure and Organization
-----------------------------------------------------
Roles and Responsibilities:

A. Peer Learning Program Leaders
   i. Director of Peer Learning (currently led by the Vice Chair for Quality and Safety):
      1. Promote the peer learning program to all radiologists
      2. Develop and maintain peer learning workflows
      3. Train radiologists on expectations and submission processes
      4. Oversee program implementation and identify best practices
      5. Support translation of feedback into quality improvement
      6. Coordinate whole-department peer learning conferences
      7. Review the annual peer learning report

   ii. Subspecialty Peer Learning Program Managers (section delegated leads):
      8. Receive and review learning opportunity submissions
      9. Discuss cases with individual radiologists when appropriate
     10. Coordinate development of subspecialty peer learning content
     11. Collaborate with the Vice Chair of Quality and Safety on quality improvement initiatives

B. Radiologists
   i. Interpret exams with an awareness of learning opportunities
  ii. Submit learning opportunities when identified
 iii. Engage in peer learning conferences

C. Administrative Support
   i. Provide logistical support for the program, including:
      1. Scheduling peer learning conferences
      2. Creating and maintaining records (attendance, case summaries)
      3. Coordinating with the CME coordinator for conference CME approval
      4. Assisting in annual report creation and OPPE case submission data collation
      5. Curating data and slides for conferences
      6. Reporting post conference case outcomes to the hospital’s Professional Practice Executive Committee (PPEC)

---

Scope
-----
This policy affects all attending clinical radiologists.

---

Materials
---------
• Appendix 1 – Primordial Peer Learning Case Submission TIPS Sheet
• Appendix 2 – Yale New Health System Radiology OPPE Form

---

Workflow/Participation
------------------------
Meaningful participation in the peer learning program is defined by two components:

1. Active Participation in Case Entry:
   • For full or part-time radiologists (excluding IR practitioners), a minimum of 24 case entries (approximately 2 cases per month on average) per academic year (July 1st – June 30th) is required.
   • Both learning opportunity and good call cases count toward this requirement (see Appendix 1 for instructions).
   • Cases deemed to offer no learning value may be removed from the participation count. Participation is prorated for leaves of absence. IR practitioners have no minimal case submission requirement for presentation.

2. Attendance:
   • At least 50% attendance is required at the department-wide quarterly peer learning conference (IRIS) for staff in certain divisions (neuroradiology, cardiothoracic, emergency, body, musculoskeletal, pediatric radiology).
   • For divisions not presenting at IRIS, participation in either the department-wide or sectional peer learning/M&M conference suffices. Sectional meetings should be held quarterly (or more frequently at the discretion of the section chief/champion).
   • Recorded conferences may be viewed with prior notification to update attendance records.

---

Reporting
---------
• The peer learning content is sequestered from individual performance evaluations. Instead, participation is noted in the OPPE evaluation for radiologists without generating performance data directly from peer learning submissions.
• The Vice Chair of Quality and Safety provides quarterly documentation to the hospital's Professional Practice and Evaluation Committee (PPEC), including:
   - Attendance lists
   - Details of cases and teaching points
   - Potential action plans arising from identified learning opportunities

Quality Improvement:
Dedicated efforts are made to translate peer learning findings into quality improvement initiatives, with coordinated oversight between the Vice Chair of Quality and Safety and a designated Radiology QI team.

Annual Report:
A summary of program accomplishments is generated from the peer learning database, including:
   1. Total number of exams submitted as peer learning opportunities or good calls
   2. Percentage of radiologists meeting attendance requirements
   3. Percentage of radiologists meeting submission requirements
   4. List of quality improvement activities linked to peer learning discussions

Appendix 1 – Primordial: Peer Learning Case Entry
---------------------------------------------------
This appendix outlines the process for submitting peer learning cases via the Primordial Communicator App:

1. Launch a study on the workstation with Visage and access the Peer Learning Software using the Primordial Communicator App. (Note: The old Peervue software will be retired.)

2. In the Communicator, select the ‘Create New’ list and click on ‘Peer Learning’.

3. In Step 1:
   a. Choose the appropriate case (typically a prior exam).
   b. Adjust the “Identified By” field if necessary (default is Radiologist).
   c. Select the correct section corresponding to the radiologist who interpreted the case.

4. Click Next to proceed to Step 2.

5. In Step 2:
   • Enter comments under the Description tab (text is mandatory even for Good Call cases).
   • Optional tabs for Clinical History and Clinical Follow may be filled out if desired.
   • Features such as Capture Region, Capture Window, and clipboard paste for screenshots may be included in future updates.

6. At the bottom, select one of the following options:
   a. Learning Opportunity – for cases with potential learning value that count toward the participation requirement.
   b. Good Call – for commendable case evaluations that also count toward the requirement.
   c. For Discussion – flags a case for potential sectional discussion; these do not count toward participation requirements.

Upon submission, the case will be forwarded to the sectional Peer Learning Champion or Section Chief. If the case is approved as a learning opportunity, an email with case details will be sent to the interpreting radiologist.

Reviewed and approved by David Facchini, Director and Jay Pahade, MD, Vice Chair of Radiology Quality and Safety.

---
PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the use of intravenous or oral, iodinated and gadolinium based contrast media, as well as the proper response of Radiology staff in the event of a contrast media event.

---
RESPONSIBILITY
1. IV and oral contrast media agents are considered medications according to the Joint Commission and, therefore, all adherences to the Medication Management Standards and all applicable YNHH drug use policies apply.
2. The patient's physician, PA, or APRN is responsible to order radiology exams, including those that require contrast media, either by written requisition or via computer order entry system. Inpatient and ED requests for contrast exams must include the patient's pregnancy status and renal function as appropriate.
3. The radiologist has primary responsibility to review pertinent, available patient history, including eGFR levels when applicable, and the appropriateness of the request for contrast media. The dose and the type of contrast administered will usually be pre-assigned per protocol performed.
4. Per YDR and DR administration, the responsibility to protocol CT exams with contrast is limited to radiology physicians and/or advanced practitioners, unless exam is eligible for autoprotocol. For exams ordered with IV contrast, the patient's eGFR should be ≥ 30. If the eGFR is < 30, follow the low eGFR workflow as follows:
   a. eGFR results for inpatient and ED patients should be within 48 hours. All inpatients and ED patients require a results value in order to proceed with contrast administration unless the exam is eligible for eGFR bypass.
   b. Any outpatient that answers ""Yes"" to a renal risk factor question on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire requires a renal function assessment. If no eGFR value is available within 6 weeks in Epic, a Point of Care (POC) eGFR test is given. eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist.
5. All personnel involved in the administration of contrast media must be aware of the steps to anticipate a contrast reaction in order to prevent it or, if one occurs, recognize it and take appropriate measures. (See Addendum 1.15A Recognition and Response to Contrast Reaction.)
6. eGFR Workflow and Responsibilities for CT:
   a. If a CT study is ordered WITH contrast and eGFR is over 30, the exam can be protocoled with IV contrast.
   b. For full trauma, life/limb threatening, or stroke code CT exams, eGFR testing is not required prior to imaging.
   c. If a CT study is ordered WITH contrast and eGFR is below 30 upon patient arrival, the technologist must notify the appropriate reading room so that the radiologist can review the case and decide how to proceed:
      i. Give contrast despite eGFR <30 – if in doubt, discuss with ordering provider and document the reasoning.
      ii. Change to CT WITHOUT contrast – if the clinical question can be answered without IV contrast, with appropriate documentation and communication (including use of 52 Modifier and contacting the CSA via email at 52Limited.Imaging@ynhh.org).
      iii. Cancel/Reschedule the exam – with cancellation noted in Epic as ""lab function out of range” and further communication with the ordering provider as needed.

---
PROCEDURE GUIDELINES FOR INTRAVENOUS (IV) CONTRAST
1. Intravenous contrast will be injected through an IV line established by the nurse or technologist. (Refer to DR Policy Medication Administration by Technologists in Diagnostic Radiology.)
2. Prior to administering IV contrast, the patient’s history (including medications and allergies) and renal screening (via questionnaire or medical record review) are completed by the technologist:
   a. If no contraindications exist, proceed with IV contrast administration per the radiologist’s protocol.
   b. If contraindications are noted, refer the case to the radiologist for further consideration.
   c. Maintain the IV line during the exam in case IV drug therapy is needed.
   d. A physician, APP, or RN must be present during the contrast administration.
   e. A contrast reaction kit and emergency equipment (including a code cart at hospital sites) must be readily available.

---
POINT OF CARE TESTING
1. Point of Care testing is performed by technologists, technologist aids, or nursing (primarily for outpatients) at the time of the appointment. This test – which assesses the quantitative measurement of creatinine in blood (capillary, venous, or arterial) and may calculate eGFR via meter or EHR – is inspected by the College of American Pathologists as part of the Department of Laboratory Medicine’s accreditation at Yale New Haven Hospital.
2. The Point of Care meter is maintained by the MRI and CT scan departments with strict adherence to a QA schedule. Staff undergo orientation and annual competency reviews on its use, with training provided by the Department of Laboratory Medicine.
3. For CT patients, any outpatient answering ""Yes"" to contrast-related questions on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire will receive point of care testing if no eGFR/Cr value is available within 6 weeks; eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist.

---
PRE-MEDICATION POLICY FOR PRIOR ALLERGIC-LIKE REACTIONS TO CONTRAST MEDIA
For planned administration of contrast agents:
• Previous reaction to allergens (e.g., shellfish, peanuts, medications, etc):
   - Mild: None
   - Moderate: None
   - Severe: None
• Previous reaction to the same class of contrast agent to be administered:
   - Mild: None
   - Moderate: Pre-medicate and use a different agent
   - Severe: Do not give contrast*
• Previous reaction to a different class of contrast agent than the one planned:
   - Mild: None
   - Moderate: None
   - Severe: None

*Unless in the opinion of the responsible health care professional and supervising radiologist, where in emergency situations the potential benefits may outweigh the risks. In such instances, the clinical provider should accompany the patient to the radiology suite to assist in management if a repeat reaction occurs.

Premedication with steroids and Benadryl is now recommended only for patients who have had a reaction to contrast of a similar class (iodinated agents used during CT versus gadolinium based agents used during MRI). Prophylaxis for reactions to other allergens is no longer necessary.

This guideline is based on the following information:
- The overall reaction risk in the general population is less than 1% (ranging from 0.2-0.6%) (Wang et al., Dillman et al.).
- Patients with a prior reaction to the same class of contrast agent have a higher repeat reaction risk (3-11% overall with a 2% breakthrough rate even with pre-medication during CT) (Mervak et al., Lasser et al.).
- The standard of care in the United States is to pre-medicate patients with steroids and antihistamines to decrease the risk of a repeat reaction in susceptible patients.
- An IV steroid regimen (as recommended below) is likely non-inferior to a longer oral regimen and is therefore recommended in the ED and inpatient settings to expedite imaging when needed (Mervak et al.).

---
Exclusions
In certain clinical scenarios, the urgency of obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI may outweigh the time required to complete the approved premedication protocol. In such cases, contrast may be administered without premedication or with a modified pretreatment protocol. This decision should be jointly agreed upon by the supervising radiologist and ordering clinician (and the patient, if feasible) with appropriate documentation in the medical record.

---
Allergic-Like Reaction Definitions
Mild:
 • Limited urticaria and/or pruritus (if treatment was not required for urticaria/pruritus).
 • Nasal congestion.
 • Cutaneous edema.
 • Sneezing, conjunctivitis, or rhinorrhea.
 • Limited ""itchy""/""scratchy"" throat.

Moderate:
 • Diffuse urticaria/pruritus requiring medical treatment.
 • Diffuse erythema with stable vital signs.
 • Facial edema without dyspnea.
 • Throat tightness or hoarseness without dyspnea.
 • Wheezing or bronchospasm with mild or no hypoxia.

Severe:
 • Diffuse edema, or facial edema with dyspnea.
 • Diffuse erythema with hypotension.
 • Laryngeal edema with stridor and/or hypoxia.
 • Wheezing/bronchospasm associated with significant hypoxia.
 • Anaphylactic shock (hypotension with tachycardia).

Notes:
(1) Physiologic reactions such as nausea, vomiting, or a sensation of warmth are unlikely to benefit from pre-medication.
(2) If urticaria/pruritus required medical treatment, it should be considered moderate in severity.

Effective Date: February 2022
Version: 2
Prepared By: Regina Hooley MD and Serena DelBasso
Management Approval: Rob Goodman, Chair of Radiology

---

A. Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure is to provide guidance to faculty members who convert administrative stipends into time off the clinical service as it relates to their expected clinical day commitment each year. The expected clinical days are based on the ladder track but may vary based on administrative responsibilities, funded research, LOA and/or part-time status. Each year the number of expected clinical days are set for each faculty member and this information is used by the department leadership to appropriately staff clinical services.
1. The replacement cost of clinical shifts is high given that full-time faculty have considerable embedded fixed costs. Replacement costs are not solely covered by the departmental daily rate.

---

B. Scope
The document will outline the process that will need to be followed to make a request to relinquish clinical service days related to clinical targets each academic year.

---

C. Procedure
Faculty who wish to use administrative stipends to relinquish time off the clinical service, and thus reduce their clinical targets will need to discuss this request with YDR leadership. Keep in mind that requests will be evaluated equally and that there is also no guarantee that your request will be approved. Requests to convert small administrative stipends to time are not encouraged, since such administrative work is often managed during the standard clinical day.
1. The cost of relinquishing time off the clinical schedule will be at the rate of $2000 per day.
2. Faculty whose administrative stipends are used to relinquish time off the clinical service understand that these must be used for academic/administrative work.
3. These days may be labelled as academic on the clinical schedule. These are not PTO days.
4. If a faculty member reduces their clinical target, but finishes the year above their reduced target, they will be reimbursed in July at the initial higher rate.

---
B. Scope
The SOP applies to all clinical faculty.
---
C. Procedures
1. Up to three bereavement days will be given to faculty for death of immediate family (parent, parent-in-law, brother, sister, spouse, child, grandparent, domestic partner, grandchild) without loss of pay.
   - a. Please contact your section chief that you will be absent. S/he will inform Serena DelBasso and/or Goodman and Hooley.
   - b. Bereavement days may be taken from clinical days and academic days, as per the existing schedule.
2. While up to three days are allowed, under certain circumstances the section chief may have the discretion to allow additional time away. Any additional time should count towards standard personal time off (e.g. PTO). If additional time is needed, one may apply for a formal University leave of absence (LOA), under the guidance of YDR HR/Marla Pella.
3. If the faculty member is away on vacation at the time of death of the immediate family member, the bereavement days may replace vacation days.
4. Bereavement days should be taken during the initial week of loss and one's clinical target will be reduced accordingly.

WHAT IS GADOLINIUM CONTRAST?
Gadolinium contrast is a type of ""contrast dye"" that is injected during MRI scans to help detect and evaluate disease. Over the last 30 years, gadolinium contrast injections have been used in hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. It is not radioactive and is different from the contrast dye used for a CT/CAT scan.
---
IS GADOLINIUM CONTRAST SAFE?
Gadolinium contrast is extremely safe. However, patients with severe kidney disease or a gadolinium contrast allergy should consult with their radiologist or personal doctor before receiving gadolinium contrast.
---
IS IT IN MY BEST INTEREST TO RECEIVE AN MRI WITH GADOLINIUM CONTRAST IF RECOMMENDED BY MY DOCTOR?
Using gadolinium contrast for an MRI exam often provides a significant benefit by allowing a variety of diseases to be more easily detected and evaluated. Sometimes, the only way the radiologist (the physician who supervises and interprets your MRI scan) can make an accurate diagnosis is with the assistance of gadolinium contrast. Your physician has ordered your MRI with gadolinium contrast based on your symptoms and history. For MRI exams performed in some Yale New Haven Health System facilities, a radiologist has reviewed your order and agreed that gadolinium contrast is likely to be beneficial.
---
WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT GADOLINIUM RETENTION?
Tiny amounts of gadolinium from the injected contrast are retained throughout the body, including within the brain. The type of gadolinium contrast used for almost all MRI exams at Yale New Haven Health facilities results in less retention than some other similar agents. To date, no known patient symptoms or diseases have been attributed to gadolinium retention in the brain, although ongoing research is in progress.
---
HOW LONG DOES GADOLINIUM STAY IN THE BODY?
The retention time in various parts of the body varies, but almost all of the contrast is removed in urine within 24 hours.
---
CAN THE AGENT HAVE AN EFFECT ON MY CURRENT MEDICATION?
NO. Gadolinium contrast does not affect other medications.
---
Women Specific:

CAN I TAKE THIS WHILE BREAST FEEDING?
Yes, see breast feeding policy.
---
CAN THIS AGENT AFFECT MY CHANCES OF GETTING PREGNANT?
No. Gadolinium contrast has no known effects on getting pregnant.
---
IS THIS AGENT SAFE DURING PREGNANCY?
If you think you may be pregnant, please notify the MRI staff, since gadolinium contrast is generally not administered to any patient who is pregnant.","The document provides substantive, self-contained FAQ content regarding gadolinium contrast, its safety, benefits, and retention details. It is intended as a script for employees, offering guidelines similar to policy content.

1. If the patient has left the department, use critical test result communication.
2. If the patient is still in the department, the radiologist and technologist discuss the case. The patient waits with the technologist. The radiologist reviews the case and attempts to contact the ordering (or covering) provider. If the patient is unstable (adult or pediatric medical emergency), 155 or 911 can be called.
3. The patient’s immediate management is discussed with the ordering (or covering) provider. Options might include ED transfer, assessment at an out-patient clinic, or discharge home with medical follow up.
4. If the patient needs to go to the ED (including when there is a finding that likely warrants immediate attention and the ordering provider team cannot be contacted) they can be transferred by staff (if the ED is onsite), by ambulance, or transport themselves. That decision should be based on the patient’s ability and clinical status.
   a. The radiologist should call the ED triage contact (numbers below) and give a verbal sign‐out to the RN or covering provider that an out-patient is being transferred from Radiology to the ED.
      i. Radiologists can write a note in the chart OR
      ii. Ensure the radiology report is viewable in Epic, which should explain the ED transfer in the impression.
   b. A radiologist should speak to the patient in person or via phone (whenever feasible) and explain:
      i. Why they need to go to the ED
      ii. If the ordering provider was able to be reached
      iii. That technologists can assist in patient communication as needed
   c. At facilities with an ED, the Radiology RN or technologist will transfer (or arrange the transfer of) the patient to the ED check-in, where care is handed off to the ED team.
   d. At off-site locations without an ED, the technologist or radiology RN should call 911 when directed to arrange for an ambulance transfer.
5. Technologists must complete the case (i.e. end the exam) before the patient leaves the department.

1.0 Purpose

This standard operating procedure (SOP) sets out the requirements for the budget process and defines revenue allocations for clinical research studies conducted in the Yale Department of Radiology (YDR) by clinical faculty. Its purpose is to provide guidance for the preparation and/or creation of clinical research budgets within YDR. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring the YDR Clinical Trials Office is informed of all funded clinical research trials which will be conducted in YDR. Clinical trials are encouraged as a potential source of scholarly output which may prove helpful for promotion. Clinical trials should not be undertaken for a faculty member's personal financial gain. All clinical trial requests must be reviewed and approved by research administration and the YDR Business office before moving forward with any additional resource or effort allocation devoted to the actual trial (see clinical Trials Office SOP).
---
2.0 Scope

This SOP provides investigators and staff with guidelines for appropriate clinical research budget preparation and creation. It also defines the role of the research team in the clinical research budget and execution process.
---
3.0 Materials

None
---
4.0 Procedures:

4.1 Establishing Appropriate Fees

4.1.1 The clinical research team will meet with the principal investigator (PI) to obtain the following information prior to the start of the budget creation. Once this information is obtained from the PI, it will be the responsibility of the clinical research team to prepare and establish all other aspects of the clinical research budget.

4.1.1.1 Distinguish which procedures/imaging studies involved in the clinical research are standard of care vs. research related.

4.1.1.1.1 It is the responsibility of the research team to retain this source documentation throughout the study.

4.1.1.2 Determine how much time will be involved to complete each research related diagnostic or clinical process and/or procedure required.

4.1.1.3 Define the appropriate fee to charge as the investigator fee, based on current billing data.

4.1.1.4 Identify any sub-investigators to be listed on the clinical research study.
---
4.2 Disbursement of Fees

4.2.1 Clinical Research Work

4.2.1.1 All funded clinical research dollars allocated to PI effort will be assessed at a 10% department administrative fee.

4.2.1.2 The department administrative fee will be used to offset the department costs associated with conducting clinical research studies, managing all transactions associated with the trial, and reporting associated with the trial.

4.2.1.3 The first use of the funds should be to cover the time and effort of the PI for clinical trials work that is funded by a grant or other funding source.

4.2.2 End of Study

4.2.2.1 At the end of the study, once all revenue is received and all expenses have been paid (PI, YNHH, YDR Administrative and coordinator, etc.) and the study is closed, any remaining funds will be split 50/50 between the PI (with the funds going into a staff or section account) and the department. Regardless of remaining balances or dollars allocated to PI efforts there will be no ""Y"" payments made directly to the PI or physician.

The FDA is requiring a new class warning and a patient information sheet for all gadolinium‐based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

Gadolinium is the ingredient in MR contrast agents that allows improved visualization of most pathologies on scans. Hundreds of millions of patients have safely received GBCAs for MRI exams since FDA approval in 1988.

After intravenous administration, minute (often microscopic) amounts of gadolinium from the GBCA is now known to be retained in many tissues of the body, including the brain. So far, studies have not found harmful effects in patients with normal kidneys, but this is an ongoing area of research.

There are many different brands/classes of GBCAs. The agents which appear less chemically stable (called linear agents) tend to have higher retention than agents that are more chemically stable (called macrocyclic agents).

---

Policy/Procedural Guidance for Radiology:

- Yale New Haven Health Systems does not use any of the chemically weaker linear gadolinium agents associated with higher rates of brain retention visible on MRI.

- Gadolinium retention in the brain is not the same as NSF (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis). Gadolinium retention happens with all GBCA contrast agents but in different amounts and in different forms. NSF has not been associated with the GBCA primarily used at Yale-New Haven Health System Radiology sites (including those patients with chronic kidney disease or on dialysis).

- Based on the best available current evidence, Yale New Haven Health System Radiology Departments do not recommend any change in current practice pattern. MRI exams that require contrast to answer the clinical question prompting the MRI can be performed as usual.

In the interest of our patients' safety, we are carefully monitoring the situation and will notify you if there are any new developments.

Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the Department of Radiology's sick leave policy, including policy when mandatory quarantining is needed even if the faculty is not actually sick. A robust sick leave policy provides security for faculty, improves staff retention and fosters good departmental relations by demonstrating a compassionate environment.

---

B. Scope

The SOP applies to all YDR clinical faculty.

---

C. Procedures

1. Occasional days of absence for may be necessary for acute and unpredictable illness, and for medical procedures.
   a. There are 4 sick days available to all clinical faculty.
   b. Any additional time off should be made up using personal time/PTO.
   c. No clinical days or shifts may be worked during the period of sick leave.
   d. YDR may require a medical certificate from the individual's physician after 3 days of absence.
   e. The 4 initial sick days should be taken from academic/administrative time. Sick days will not alter one's clinical target.
   f. Sick days should be used only for faculty personal illness.

2. Sick time absences of up to 2 weeks
   a. Base salary will continue to be paid during this time.
   b. Make up clinical days should take place during academic/PTO days unless the period of absence takes place during the last four months of the academic year (March to June).
      - In this scenario, faculty will remain eligible for the current year's Productivity Supplements, but clinical work days missed will be made up during the following academic year.
   c. YDR may require a medical certificate from the individual's physician after the 2nd week of absence.
   d. Mandatory quarantining & COVID-19 (if applicable) - If the faculty member is sick and unable to work, standard sick leave policy will be followed for the duration of the illness. If the faculty member recovers, but is still under mandatory quarantine, efforts should be made to facilitate remote/home work days where possible.
      - If the faculty member is placed in quarantine for reasons other than acute illness, efforts should be made to facilitate remote/home work days where possible.
      - For days during quarantine where working remotely is not possible, normal sick leave policy will be followed. This means that academic/PTO days will need to be used when the faculty member cannot work clinically from home.

3. Continuous sick leave absences of between 2 weeks and 6 months
   a. Base salary will continue to be paid during this time. ED contract will be adjusted for completion of effort. Annual Clinical Day Equivalent expectation will be prorated for time off.
   b. Eligibility for Clinical Productivity Supplement will be prorated depending on the length of absence.
   c. Academic Supplement eligibility will not be dependent on length of leave.
   d. YDR may require a medical certificate from the individual's physician every 2 weeks of absence thereafter.
   e. This level of coverage may be discontinued at any time at the Chair's discretion.

4. Continuous sick leave absences of greater than 6 months
   a. The Office of the Provost should be consulted, and the University's long-term disability policy may apply. The department's financial responsibility would cease.
   b. Faculty can apply for CT Paid Family Medical Leave (PFMLA) income replacement benefits and may be eligible to receive income replacement for up to 12 weeks in a 12‐month period. The amount of income replacement depends on the employee's income, and is calculated by a formula up to a cap of $780 per week (rate subject to change at the state's discretion).

Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the YDR/YSM faculty child rearing leave benefit, which provides faculty protected time with a newborn or newly adopted child under the age of six without any penalty with regards to employment.
---
B. Scope

The SOP applies to full-time clinical and research faculty. Part-time faculty who are working at least half-time (50% or more work effort) will receive similar benefits.
---
C. Procedures:

1. Effective January 1, 2022, faculty working in the state of CT are eligible to apply for Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) benefits through the State of Connecticut Paid Leave Authority. Under the PFML, faculty are eligible for up to 12 weeks of paid child rearing leave in a 12-month period.
2. Faculty may extend leave beyond 12 weeks by using PTO and/or unpaid leave. The total leave should not exceed 6 months, including the initial 12 weeks. The leave does not need to be continuous.
3. There is an option for an additional 8 weeks part-time status with pay commensurate with part-time work effort.
4. If both parents are eligible faculty members, each are independently entitled to the paid child rearing leave.
---
Extension of Appointment

As per YSM guidelines, any full-time faculty member who takes paid and/or unpaid child rearing leave may request a one-year extension of his/her appointment.
---
Application

As soon as possible (and before commencement of leave), faculty should complete the child rearing leave request form and submit the completed form to Marla Pelle, Associate Director for Academic Affairs (marla.pelle@yale.edu). Additionally, faculty should complete the CT PFML application at https://ctpaidleave.org/s/employee-landing-page?language=en-US. Yale will coordinate with the State of Connecticut to provide any supporting documentation requested. Any changes should be reported to Marla Pelle and one's Division/Section Chief as soon as possible.
---
Limitations

No departmental clinical work may be undertaken during the leave period.
---
Clinical Target

Child rearing leave will reduce clinical faculty member's clinical workday target. Faculty who work over their reduced target before or after the leave period will be eligible for standard y-payments.

As part of Yale’s mission, Yale is committed to “the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community.” That diversity includes all people regardless of ability or disability.

Websites and web applications are integral to the university’s academic and administrative work. Yale is committed to making information, programs and activities on its websites and web applications accessible to people with disabilities through its [Web Accessibility Policy](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/1605-web-accessibility-policy). The Web Accessibility Policy applies to websites and applications that conduct university business, including all Yale School of Medicine, Yale School of Public Health, and Yale Cancer Center websites. Owners of such sites should be familiar with this policy and the [Web Accessibility Procedure](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/procedures/1605-pr01-web-accessibility-procedure). People in roles that work on University websites and web applications should explore this website and take advantage of [Yale’s accessibility resources and trainings](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles).

Why is this policy important?

This policy supports Yale’s mission to disseminate knowledge and promote diversity and inclusion throughout our community. The web is a primary source of information for nearly everyone, and this policy is one step toward making Yale’s web content more accessible to everyone—including the almost 20% of U.S. citizens who have some form of disability. Testing our websites with assistive technologies allows us to improve content compatibility with assistive tools such as screen readers.

---

How does this impact us at YSM?

We need to be sure that all Yale School of Medicine websites (including those for Yale Medicine, Yale Cancer Center, and Yale School of Public Health) meet accessibility standards in accordance with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).

The policy states:
• After March 1, 2018, all new content entered into any YSM sites must be accessible.
• After September 1, 2018, all new websites or sites undergoing substantial revisions or redesign must be accessible.
• After September 1, 2018, if an outside vendor is used to create a website, the website owner must ensure that the vendor delivers accessible technology. In addition, existing websites provided by outside vendors may be required to be made accessible.

**Current Status**

As announced in the CY 2024 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) [Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/16/2023-24184/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-cy-2024-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other), effective January 1, 2024, CMS has paused efforts to implement the AUC program for reevaluation and rescinded the AUC regulations at 42 CFR 414.94. See pages 79256-79265 of the final rule.

Effective January 1, 2024, providers and suppliers should no longer include AUC consultation information on Medicare FFS claims. However, claims containing AUC related codes with dates of service in 2023 and 2024 will continue to process through December 31, 2024.

Additionally, CMS will no longer qualify PLEs or CDSMs and has removed this information from the AUC website. The claims processing instructions and guidance for the previous voluntary period and educational and operations testing period will be removed.

For more information, see the following guidance documents issued in February 2024:

• One Time Notification - Appropriate Use Criteria for Advanced Diagnostic Imaging Policy Update in the Calendar Year 2024 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule ([CR 13458, Transmittal 12508, issued 2024-02-15 (PDF)](/files/document/r12508otn.pdf))

---

**Background**

The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) of 2014, Section 218(b), authorized a program to increase the rate of appropriate advanced diagnostic imaging services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Examples of such advanced imaging services include:
• computed tomography (CT)
• positron emission tomography (PET)
• nuclear medicine, and
• magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Under this program, at the time a practitioner orders an advanced diagnostic imaging service for a Medicare beneficiary, he/she, or clinical staff acting under his/her direction, will be required to consult a qualified Clinical Decision Support Mechanism (CDSM). CDSMs are electronic portals through which appropriate use criteria (AUC) is accessed. The CDSM provides a determination of whether the order adheres to AUC, or if the AUC consulted was not applicable (e.g., no AUC is available to address the patient’s clinical condition). A consultation must take place at the time of the order for imaging services that will be furnished in one of the designated settings and paid for under one of the specified payment systems. Ultimately, practitioners whose ordering patterns are considered outliers will be subject to prior authorization. Information on outlier methodology and prior authorization is not yet available.

This program impacts all physicians and practitioners (as defined in 1861(r) or described in 1842(b)(18)(C)) that order advanced diagnostic imaging services and physicians, practitioners, and facilities that furnish advanced diagnostic imaging services in settings such as a physician’s office, hospital outpatient department (including the emergency department), an ambulatory surgical center, or an independent diagnostic testing facility (IDTF) whose claims are paid under the physician fee schedule, hospital outpatient prospective payment system, or ambulatory surgical center payment system.

---

**Program Timeline**

• In the CY 2024 PFS Final Rule (November 16, 2023), CMS paused implementation of the AUC program for reevaluation and rescinded the AUC regulations at 42 CFR 414.94. CMS has not specified a timeframe within which implementation efforts will recommence. See pages 79256-79265 of the final rule.
• In 2023, CMS announced on this website that the Education and Operations Testing Period would continue until further notice and that the penalty phase would not begin on January 1, 2023, even if the public health emergency (PHE) ended in CY 2022.
• In the CY 2022 PFS Final Rule (November 2021), CMS further delayed full implementation until the later of January 1, 2023 or the January 1 that follows the declared end of the public health emergency for COVID-19.
• In July 2020, in response to the COVID-19 PHE, CMS extended the Education and Operations Testing Period.
• Beginning January 1, 2020, the program operated in an Education and Operations Testing Period, during which claims will not be denied for failing to include proper AUC consultation information.
• From July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, the program operated under a voluntary participation period during which consultations with AUC were reported on furnishing professional and facility claims using HCPCS modifier QQ.
