A Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure SOP is to describe the YDR policy for the formal interpretation and consultation of outside imaging studies aka outside 2nd read requests The purpose of this practice is to help minimize the risk of harm to patients when clinical decisions are based on imaging findings performed outside YNHH Performing an official consultation on outside studies also decreases additional radiation exposure and healthcare costs from repeatduplicative exams Institutions with similar policies have shown that a change in diagnosis occurs in approximately 8 of cases Zan E Yousem DM et al Secondopinion Consultations in Neuroradiology Radiology 2010 2551 13541



B Scope

1 Formal consultation and interpretations of outside studies may be requested for CT MRI and PETCT scans less than 90 days old Outside consultation requests for exams older than 90 days may be automatically canceled by Radiology Image Library staff
2 Unofficial Curbside consults should not be provided for CT MRI or PET exams that are eligible for an outside read
3 Outside studies being discussed at tumor boards or other multidisciplinary conferences must be uploaded using the process outlined above if the study is less than 90 days old
4 Imaging performed and interpreted at other YNHHS sites Greenwich Bridgeport Lawrence  Memorial Westerly are also ELIGIBLE for outside consultation and interpretation by Yale Radiology unless the patient is currently an inpatient at the other YNHHS site Smilow affiliated cancer sites such as St Francis are also eligible Exams performed at any Bridgeport Hospital facility locations that are read by a YDR radiologist are not eligible for outside read



C Exemptions

1 Formal consultation and interpretation of outside studies is not available for ultrasound Xray and nuclear medicine exams except PETCTs
2 Exams from the Veterans VA health system are not eligible The radiologist should dictate a sentence stating study is not eligible
3 Requests for consultation and interpretation of outside studies that have more recent or pending relevant imaging are exempt since the older exam will only be used as a reference when interpreting the newer study Example a CT spine does not have to be read if a newer MRI spine will also be read The radiologist should dictate a sentence stating why second read is not performed
4 Studies performed at Bridgeport Hospital outpatient sites and ShorelineHamden and RCPC YNHH radiology sites are NOT eligible as those exams are interpreted by Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging radiologists

E Procedures

1 To generate a formal outside imaging interpretation usually done by the requesting MD andor support staff three methods are available
   a Using Powershare Software
   b Using EPIC
       For cases where images are already uploaded in PACS
       In EPIC order search bar type the word outside
       Choose the correct Outside Interpretation order for the study you are requesting to be read and provide relevant clinical history Imaging of the brain or spine is handled by the neuroradiology section Imaging of the abdomen andor pelvis is handled by the body section
       Orders placed via EPIC but without images uploaded into PACS within 72 hours will be canceled by file room staff A repeat order can be placed when images become available by the ordering provider
   c Uploading a disc if you do not have access to Life Image
       If you have a disc you may drop it off at the Image Library South or North Pavilion second floor to be uploaded
       Fill out the import request form provided by the Image Library Staff Be sure to indicate on the form that you would like a secondary read

2 Imaging will populate the appropriate radiologist worklist after being processed by Radiology File room staff All CT Chestabdomenpelvis exams will be split into two accessions for an outside read CT chest and outside read CT body
3 The patients insurance company will be billed for the professional component fee for Yale Radiology interpretation RVUs will be generated for each report and assigned to the billing radiologist Interpretations will be provided within 24 hours for inpatients and 48 hours for outpatient studies once available for radiologist dictation in PACS
4 An outside read template is required for all reports Templates are available in Powerscribe The following statement should be in all reports for billing purposes
   This second interpretation is requested by the treating physician and the interpretation will directly contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient
5 Inadequate studies cases where adequate history is not available in EPIC or the order or cases that are not eligible for other reasons still need a dictation stating why the study will not be read
   a Do not dictate anything about billing the patient in your report This will be handled by billers
6 Patients whose cases are presented at tumor board by affiliate community Smilow Care Cancer physicians eg St Francis Smilow physicians will not be billed
   a The case will not be submitted for payment by the billing department which maintains a list of qualifying community physicians to encourage tumor board presentations without added costs Cases presented by YNHH Smilow physicians are eligible and will be billed
