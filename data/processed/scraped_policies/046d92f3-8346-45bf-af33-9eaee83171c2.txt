A Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure SOP is to describe the Department of Radiologys process for clinical shift scheduling and provide guidance for faculty who may sign up for two shifts within a single 24hour period Prolonged and overlapping shifts as well as extended double shifts may lead to increased stress fatigue and lack of concentration These effects may in turn impact patient safety with data within and outside of medicine showing higher rates of unintentional error It is the goal of the department to allow adequate gaps between assigned clinical shifts to ensure faculty are given an adequate period to restrecover



B Scope

1 The SOP applies to all YDR clinical shifts exclusive of emergent afterhours work done during a call shift
