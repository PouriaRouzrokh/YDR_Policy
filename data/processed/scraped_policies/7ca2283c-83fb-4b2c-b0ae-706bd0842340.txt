Title Time off Clinical service for Grant Funded research on CES track
Prepared By David C Madoff
Management Approval Rob Goodman MD  Date January 2022

10 Purpose
This SOP is intended to define how grant funded research  effort is applied to clinical effort for clinician scientists who are on the CES track

Scope
Faculty may be awarded research  effort as part of individual or collaborative grant awards This research effort may be used to reduce clinical  effort Clinical faculty on scholarly tracks already receive dedicated academic time but may need increased academic time due to funding success This SOP applies to both selfinitiated and industry grants and is beyond the prescriptive level provided by training grants eg NIH Kaward Doris Duke Charitable Funding YCCI etc to which the award rules will apply

Materials
None

40 Procedures
41 If a faculty member secures grant funding  effort this may be used in conjunction with departmentally funded  nonclinical effort

42 CES Track with grant funded research
Any grant funded  effort above 10 will be applied towards a reduction in clinical  effort Due to the need for a minimum level of clinical activity no faculty member on the CES track will be able to have less than 50 clinical effort

421 For example
 If a CES track faculty member with 20 departmentally funded nonclinical effort receives 10 research effort their clinical  effort will be unchanged
 If a CES track faculty member with 20 departmentally funded nonclinical effort receives 15 research effort their clinical effort will be reduced by an additional 5

422 Multiple small grants held by a single faculty member may be additive
 Example Five 3 grants may be equivalent to a single 15 grant Their clinical effort would be reduced by 5

43 CES Track with independent PI grant funded research
Any grant funded  effort will be applied towards a reduction in clinical  effort in addition to the Departmental 20 nonclinical effort Due to the need for a minimum level of clinical activity no faculty member on the CESCS track with nontraining grant funding should have less than 50 clinical effort

431 For example
 If a CES track faculty member with 20 departmentally funded nonclinical effort receives 10 research effort as a PI from an RO1 their clinical  effort will be reduced by an additional 10

432 Multiple small grants held by a single faculty member may be additive
 Example 5 3 grants may be equivalent to a single 15 grant Their clinical effort will be reduced by an additional 15
