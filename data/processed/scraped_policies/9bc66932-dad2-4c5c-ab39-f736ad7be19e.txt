Situation

There is variation in practice across YNHHS Radiology departments with placement of pelvicgonadal shields during CT exams including for pediatric and pregnant patients



Background

CT scans use ionizing radiation in order to produce diagnostic images A common misconception by radiology and clinical team members is placing a lead shield around the patients pelvis during a CT is protective and helps reduce radiation dose to this part of the body Most radiation to the pelvic region during a CT scan that is not imaging the pelvis is from internal scatter radiation within the body while a lead shield is only effective in reducing external scatter radiation radiation from outside the patients body



Assessment

A phantom study was conducted by the YNHHS medical physics team to measure the actual radiation dose inside the pelvis during various CT scans of the head and chest with and without a lead shield in place This confirmed that a lead shield did NOT alter the radiation dose to the pelvis compared to measurements done without the lead shield A lead shield may also pose some risk of harm With fast moving CT table technology there is a risk of getting the shield caught in the system hardware and if the lead shield is accidentally included in the field of view of the CT being acquired it will result in increased radiation dose if automated tube current modulation is being used During the COVID19 pandemic infection control practices for lead shields are also critical This takes technologist time and medical supplies to ensure each shield is thoroughly cleaned beforeafter patient use



Recommendation

YNHHS Radiology does not recommend routine placement of lead shields over the pelvis during any CT scans including pediatric and pregnant patients traditionally viewed as higher risk as it does not provide measurable benefit in gonadal radiation dose reduction The ALARA as low as reasonably achievable principle should always be used with proper scan settings and limited zaxis to minimize any unnecessary radiation exposure A pelvic lead shield can be selectively used for patients who display high levels of anxietyconcern and request one or if it helps decrease patient movement during the CT
