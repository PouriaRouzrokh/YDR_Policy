Clinical radiation safety precautions should be followed when providing care to patients receiving radiopharmaceutical therapy
NOTE EMERGENT AND LIFESAVING CARE SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED DUE TO RADIATION PRECAUTIONS



General Radiation Safety
The two basic concepts related to ionizing radiation are defined as follows
 Exposure  the energy given off by a radioactive material
 Contamination  the presence of radioactive material on a person or item

Contamination control is the primary concern for healthcare staff interacting with radiopharmaceutical therapy patients The appropriate use of personal protective equipment PPE and proper handling of contaminated waste are essential to protect staff and prevent the spread of contamination Standard PPE gloves shoe covers gown is recommended with double gloving advised for handling contaminated body fluids

Although exposure risk to staff from these patients is low any necessary countermeasures will follow the principles of time distance and shielding or be determined by the radiation safety office



Pluvicto Lu177 vipivotide tetraxetan
PLUVICTO lutetium Lu177 vipivotide tetraxetan is used to treat adults with prostate cancer The treatment is administered every 6 weeks and is excreted through the kidneys with detectable radiation present in bodily fluids urine saliva emesis blood etc for several days

Precautions for 7 days posttreatment
 Use universal precautions in all patient interactions and when handling blood and bodily fluids
 Patient excreta urine stool emesis may be safely flushed down toilets flush twice to ensure complete emptying
 Collect items used for excreta in a dedicated waste bin to avoid mixing with ordinary waste
 For patients with urinary catheters or drainage bags empty and flush the urine but discard the drainage bag as radiation waste in a dedicated container
 Seal and label any collected bodily fluids eg from paracentesis as Hold for Radiation Safety Department and store them separately from standard waste streams
 Contact the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine department for disposal instructions
 Ensure the treatment room is held until it is cleared by the radiation safety office or nuclear medicine for reuse

Radiation Safety Department Contact information is repeated for various hospitals In emergencies contact the patients attending oncologist Dr Petrylak Kim Hurwitz or the oncall provider immediately



Lutathera Lu177 dotatate
LUTATHERA lutetium Lu177 dotatate is indicated for adults with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors GEPNETs that express the somatostatin receptor The treatment is given every 8 weeks with excretion via the kidneys and radioactive material present in excreta for several days postinfusion

Precautions for 7 days posttreatment
 Use universal precautions for all patient interactions and when handling bodily fluids
 Flush patient excreta urine stool emesis down toilets flush twice to ensure complete emptying
 Place items used for excreta collection in a dedicated waste bin
 Secure any collected bodily fluids in a sealed container label it as Hold for Radiation Safety Department and store it separately from standard waste
 Contact the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine department for disposal instructions
 Hold the treatment room until clearance is obtained from the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine

Again contact details for the Radiation Safety Department are provided and in urgent cases the patients attending oncologist or oncall provider should be contacted



Radioactive lodine I131 Sodium lodide
Radioactive lodine often called RAI is commonly used in the treatment of thyroid diseases including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer Although RAI is usually a single administration multiple doses may be necessary and radioactive material can be detected in patient excreta urine saliva sweat for several days

Precautions for 7 days posttreatment
 If possible place the patient in a single room with a dedicated bathroom
 Use appropriate PPE gown gloves shoe covers for all patient interactions
 Dispose of PPE in designated waste bins
 Flush patient excreta down toilets flush twice to ensure complete emptying
 Place items used for collection of excreta in a dedicated waste bin
 Contact the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine department for disposal instructions
 Hold the treatment room until clearance is given by the Radiation Safety Office or Nuclear Medicine

Radiation Safety Department contact information is provided as above for handling these precautions
