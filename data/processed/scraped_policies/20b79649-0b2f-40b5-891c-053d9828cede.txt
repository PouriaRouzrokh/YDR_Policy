10 Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure SOP is to describe the policy and provide guidance for Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation OPPE within YDR

20 Scope
This SOP applies to all radiologists and licensed independent practitioners employed by YDR with medical staff privileges

30 Materials
Appendix 1  Yale New Haven Health System YNHHS Radiology OPPE Form

40 Procedures
41 The Joint Commission TJC requires Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation OPPE forms to be completed for all medical providers at the frequency of about every nine months but not to exceed greater than every 12 months Per the TJC an OPPE identifies professional practice trends that may impact the quality and safety of care and applies to all practitioners granted privileges via the Medical Staff chapter requirements A welldesigned process supports early detection and response to performance issues that could negatively impact patient outcomes

42 For Yale Radiology we have modeled our OPPE to use similar categories as used by the ACGME core competency model encompassing 1 Patient Care 2 Interpersonal  Communication Skills 3 Professionalism and 4 SystemsBased Practice See Appendix 1 for YNHHS Radiology OPPE Form

43 The Departmental Program Manager is responsible for generating OPPE forms for review by the Vice Chair Quality of Safety Vice Chair Clinical Affairs andor Section Chief for review and approval and then final submission to the Departmental Chairman for review

44 Forms will be prepared with prepopulated providermetric data by departmental administration where applicable An X will be placed within the appropriate column of Acceptable Needs Improvement or Not Applicable for remaining metrics by the designee assessing the practicing radiologistLIP

There are four qualitative assessments on the form within each of the categories where DivisionSection chiefs can provide commentsrecommendations for providers who receive a Needs Improvement designation

45 Metrics scored as Needs Improvement may identify performance issues that could negatively affect patient care An OPPE is a broad screening tool and it is recognized that many providers who do not meet acceptable or threshold goals for assessed categories will not be deemed as an outlier after further investigation A Focused Professional Practice Evaluation FPPE may need to be conducted based on review of the OPPE form if the provider is felt to be an outlier for what the department deems an acceptable standard of care The final decision to consider an FPPE will be made by the Chairman upon review of overall physician performance

46 If physicians were not in the Department for part or all of the identified dates for OPPE their data will either be prorated or labeled Not Applicable NA
