 PURPOSE

To provide guidelines for the use of intravenous or oral iodinated and gadolinium based contrast media as well as the proper response of Radiology staff in the event of a contrast media event

 RESPONSIBILITY

1 IV and oral contrast media agents are considered medications under Joint Commission standards all applicable YNHH drug use policies apply
2 The patients physician PA or APRN orders radiology exams including those requiring contrast via written requisition or computer order entry Inpatient and ED requests must include information such as pregnancy status and renal function as appropriate
3 The radiologist is primarily responsible for reviewing the patients history including eGFR levels when applicable and ensuring the appropriateness of contrast use with the dose and agent typically preassigned per protocol
4 For CT exams ordered with IV contrast only radiology physicians andor advanced practitioners or autoprotocoleligible exams may protocol the study In these exams the patients eGFR should be  30 If eGFR is  30 the following workflow applies
   a Inpatients and ED patients must have eGFR results within 48 hours unless the exam qualifies for bypass
   b Outpatients who answer Yes to a renal risk factor question on the CT OralIV Contrast Questionnaire require renal function assessment If no eGFR is available within 6 weeks in Epic a Point of Care POC eGFR test is provided and levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist
5 All personnel involved in administering contrast media must know the procedures to anticipate prevent recognize and respond to contrast reactions see Addendum 115A Recognition and Response to Contrast Reaction



 6 eGFR Workflow and Responsibilities for CT

a For CT studies ordered WITH contrast and with eGFR over 30 the exam can proceed with IV contrast

b For CT studies with a LifeLimb Threatening priority eg full trauma or stroke code eGFR testing is not required prior to imaging

c For CT studies WITH contrast and eGFR below 30 upon patient arrival
   i The technologist contacts the appropriate reading room so a radiologist can review the case and decide whether to
      1 Proceed with contrast despite eGFR  30 after discussion with the ordering provider and documenting the reasoning
      2 Change the exam to CT WITHOUT contrast with documentation and specific actions such as placing a 52 Modifier and emailing rationale or
      3 Cancelreschedule the exam with the cancellation reason noted in Epic by the Clinical Scheduling Assistant
   ii The radiologists decision is documented in the Epic study notes
   iii If changes or cancellations occur the CSA communicates with the ordering physicians office using an approved script if disagreement arises the radiologists decision prevails



 PROCEDURE GUIDELINES FOR INTRAVENOUS IV CONTRAST

1 IV contrast is administered through an established IV line by a nurse or technologist Refer to DR Policy Medication Administration by Technologists in Diagnostic Radiology

2 Before IV contrast administration the patients historyincluding medications allergies and renal impairment screeningis reviewed via the medical record or outpatient questionnaire
   a If no contraindications are present proceed per the radiologists protocol
   b If contraindications exist the case is referred to the radiologist
   c The IV line is maintained during the exam in case IV drug therapy becomes necessary
   d A physician APP or RN must be on site during contrast administration
   e A contrast reaction kit and emergency equipment eg a code cart at hospital sites must be immediately available

3 Point of Care POC testing is performed by technologists or nursing staff to measure creatinine and calculate eGFR to assess renal function

4 The POC meter is maintained by the MRI and CT scan departments under a strict QA schedule that includes staff training and annual competency reviews by the Department of Laboratory Medicine

5 For POC Renal Function Testing in Radiology
   a MRI Patients See the MRI safety manual for details
   b CT Patients Outpatients answering Yes to contrastrelated questions on the CT OralIV Contrast Questionnaire receive POC testing if no eGFRCr value is available within 6 weeks with eGFR levels under 30 being referred to the radiologist



 For Planned Administration of Contrast Agents

Previous reaction to allergens eg shellfish peanuts medications

Mild  Moderate  Severe
    
None  None  None

Previous reaction to the same class of contrast agent planned to be given

Mild  Moderate  Severe
    
None  Premedicate and use a different agent  Do not give contrast

Previous reaction to a different class of contrast agent than the one planned

Mild  Moderate  Severe
    
None  None  None

Unless in the opinion of the responsible health care professional and supervising radiologist the benefits outweigh the risks eg in emergency situations In such cases the clinical provider should accompany the patient to the radiology suite to manage any repeat reaction

Premedication with steroids and Benadryl is now recommended only for patients with a prior reaction to the same class of contrast agent iodinated for CT and gadoliniumbased for MRI Prophylaxis for reactions to other allergens is no longer necessary

Evidence supporting these guidelines includes
 An estimated overall reaction risk of 1 approximately 0206 Wang et al Dillman et al
 Patients with a prior reaction face a 311 overall reaction rate and a 2 breakthrough reaction rate despite premedication during CT Mervak et al Lasser et al
 An IV steroid regimen detailed below is considered noninferior to a longer oral regimen and is recommended in ED and inpatient settings to expedite imaging Mervak et al



 Exclusions

In certain clinical circumstances the urgency of a contrastenhanced CT or MRI may override the benefits of fully executing the premedication protocol In these cases contrast may be administered without premedication or with a modified protocol Such decisions should be made jointly by the supervising radiologist and the ordering clinician and the patient if feasible with appropriate documentation in the medical record

 Allergic Like Reaction Definitions 1

Mild              Moderate                      Severe

Limited urticariapruritis 2  Diffuse urticariapruritis  Diffuse edema or facial edema with dyspnea
Nasal congestion  Diffuse erythema with stable vital signs  Diffuse erythema with hypotension
Cutaneous edema   Facial edema without dyspnea   Laryngeal edema with stridor andor hypoxia
Sneezingconjunctivitisrhinorrhea  Throat tightness or hoarseness without dyspnea  Wheezingbronchospasm with significant hypoxia
Limited itchyscratchy throat  Wheezingbronchospasm with mild or no hypoxia  Anaphylactic shock hypotension  tachycardia

0
0 1 Physiologic reactions such as nausea vomiting or a feeling of warmth are unlikely to benefit from premedication 2 If urticariapruritis required medical treatment it should be considered moderate in severity
