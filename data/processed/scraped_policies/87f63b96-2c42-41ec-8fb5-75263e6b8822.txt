REVISED 1172020
AVITABLE JOHN

Downtime Report Resolution Procedure

The purpose of this document is to set the expectation for what the Clinical Imaging Technology teams responsibilities are in the event of a planned Epic downtime resulting in temporary accessions being generated

 Preliminary Tasks
  1 Determine relevant staff that will be working during Downtime
     a Go to amioncomhttpamioncom to find YSC and SRC oncall Resident and Radiologist
         Attending Schedule can be found on yaleradqgendacomhttpyaleradqgendacom
     b Eileana Valentin EileanaValentinbpthosporg is the contact for BH residency at this time
     c GH uses Nighthawk Telerad service for overnight ED exams which are faxed in and are thus unaffected by an Epic downtime
  2 Email the relevant staff to remind them of the downtime You may wish to include a phone number that you can be reached at if any issues are encountered

 200AM  Downtime Begins

Orders for imaging exams will be written on paper These paper orders will have a sticker placed on them with the DowntimeTemporary Accession number When performing these exams technologists will track the exams that they perform on a log sheet The log sheet should include Patient Name MRN Exam Type Exam Date and Time Temporary Accession and Epic Accession

While the technologists are performing exams and recording information on the logs Radiologists are dictating in PowerScribe on temporary accessions Radiologists may include additional information in their report such as Patient Name and MRN though they are not required to do so

 600AM  Downtime Ends

After the downtime ends you will receive notification from Production Control that the downtime activities have been completed successfully Once the Production system comes back up the Technologists will begin placing scheduling and completing the orders that were placed on paper during the downtime

Once all orders are placed and their Epic accession numbers noted the log will be sent to DITrainingynhhorg along with contact information for the individual who submitted the log

 Associating Temporary Accessions with Epic Accessions

Once you receive logs you can begin associating temporary accessions with Epic accessions No temporary accession will be associated without proper documentation You should not have to do additional research or make judgment calls to decide whether or where a temporary accession should be associated If there are any questions contact the person who sent the log

To associate Temporary Accessions log in to the PowerScribe webportal and search for all temporary accessions created in the past 24 hours

 Site            Order Status       Patient Class       Account         
                                     
 All            Temporary       All              All             
 Locking         Report Status     Section         Ordering Physician         
 All            All                            All            
 Time Frame Custown  Transfer Status     Location             Reset  Search 4 

A list of search results will appear which should include all of the temporary accessions that were created during the downtime as well as other accessions that do not need to be addressed You will only be associating temporary accessions that have been appropriately documented on the log Different sites may prefix their temporary accession numbers to denote the originating location Accessions that include a patients name should be disregarded

From the search results screen click the Actions link on the right of the screen and select the Associate option After clicking Associate you will have the option to add or replace the order Select the Replace option Then search for the Epic accession number and complete the association Once completed the system will wait 3 minutes and send the report to Epic alternatively you can force the report to send immediately

After sending the report to Epic confirm that it appears appropriately and was transmitted through the interface There may be issues with interfaces on both the Epic and PowerScribe sides especially during a downtime

 700AM  Status Report

At 700AM you should begin receiving downtime logs Send a status report that includes information about who has sent logs at what time and what is still pending This email should be sent to

 YDR Administrators
 YDR Section Chiefs
 YSC ED Overnight Staff
 YNHH Radiology Management
 BH Radiology Management
 Matthew Zawalich and Heather Hogle

 FollowUp Status Report

After sending the initial status report and continuing to associate temporary accessions as they are received send another email updating key staff on the progress made This followup email generally goes to management only excluding the radiologistsYDR Section Chiefs

In this followup email reference any issues encountered difficulties in obtaining necessary information and note successes such as a location providing timely logs

 Final Status Report

Once all temporary accessions have been associated with the appropriate Epic accession numbers send a final summary email to all parties including the radiologists YDR Section Chiefs confirming that all temporary accessions have been appropriately associated and verified in Epic

 Deleting Temporary Accessions

As a final task delete the temporary accessions that have been associated This is a lower priority task and can be completed after other tasks have been finished
