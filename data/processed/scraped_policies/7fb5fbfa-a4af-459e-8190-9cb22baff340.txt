A Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure SOP is to describe the Department of Radiologys process for inclement weather and other unforeseen operational circumstances requiring radiology services to be suspended In these instances our top priority is to continue to provide excellent and accessible patient care while maintaining the safety of our radiologists



B Scope

a The SOP applies to YNHH and BH radiology inpatient and outpatient sites
b There will inevitably be occasions when clinical operations are curtailed due to unforeseen circumstances such as snowstorms hurricanes and other unpredictable events During these times clinical radiology activity will be reduced



C Procedures

a The VC for Clinical Affairs will communicate YNHHBH operational changes to faculty and trainees
b Faculty should be flexible depending on conditions The goal is to staff to demand
c An appropriate number of faculty should work from home whenever possible
d Expected coverage and appropriate staffing is the responsibility of the divisionsection chiefs depending on the situation and expected reduced caseload Minimal staffing guidelines may revert to a weekend staffing model or other curtailed staffing model

Guide to Minimum Coverage if a weekend staffing model is not used

 If additional staffing is required it should be approved by the Chair or VC Clinical Affairs
 All faculty should be WFH whenever possible as determined by their DivisionSection Chief

e Radiologist staffing should mirror closures of staffed outpatient facilities ie if an ambulatory center is closed the radiologist scheduled for that site would no longer be required In the unusual situation where an outpatient site is maintained open appropriate remote andor onsite staffing should be arranged in addition to the above Note that there may be outpatient procedures at YNHH SRC and SMC although usually limited

f Decisions as to whether radiologists are required inhouse will be made by the Section Chief This decision may be based on safety distance needed to traveltype of car and those most willing to work On occasion the person listed oncall may be responsible for inhouse coverage

g Faculty not working on those days will be deemed to be on an academic day They will not lose claim to PTO due to this mandated absence from the clinical schedule If necessary a snow day make up slot may be added to the clinical schedule if approved by the Chair or VC for Clinical Affairs

h Resident coverage needed will be decided by the Section Chiefs Which residents come in should be determined by the Chief Residents For the residents who do not come in that day will not be counted as a vacation day

i Multiday storms and other rare scenarios may require coverage adjustment

j If a storm is less severe than predicted faculty may be required to come in despite an earlier cancellation of services

k YNHH may provide inhouse boarding for faculty who need to stay overnight If faculty need to book lodging elsewhere they should get prior approval by YDR administration and use hotels offering Yale discounts
