FAQs
Q What does the faculty handbook say about TSL
A University guidance states the following
    It is a privilege and not a right
    It is awarded for periods up to 4 months triennial and up to 6 months sabbatical
    It should be taken in blocks of at least 1 month
    For accounting purposes TSL must be taken in the period for which it is approved Jan thru June  for Jan 1st eligibility July thru June  for July 1st eligibility
    If the applicant is unable to take the TSL in the year awarded it may be deferred and will be given priority in the subsequent year
    If the applicant takes only a portion of the TSL during the year awarded the remaining time may not roll over into subsequent years

Q What factors will be considered in the TSL approval process
A The TSL Committee will take into account the following
    Purpose and merits of the submitted leave of absence plan
    Time needed to execute the plan
    Time since previous TSL
    Other TSLs requested concurrently within the applicants clinical section
    Other leaves of absence parental sick administrative phased retirement within the applicants clinical section
    The amount of additional work to be covered by the applicants colleagues during their absence

Q Can I augment my income during my TSL
A During your TSL no additional income may be derived from working clinically through your leave Income from TIMC moonlighting shifts and paid call will be allowed

Q Does this mean that I could have decreased net income during my TSL
A If you augment your income with other departmental activities you may not be able to earn this additional income during your TSL However you will still be eligible for your full Clinical Productivity Bonus Clinical tract or Academic Productivity Bonus Clinician Educator tract regardless of the length of your approved TSL

Q Is there any way to make up for lost income during my TSL
A Your TSL is intended to provide you with an opportunity for professional growth and development and also to recharge your batteries Nevertheless you may earn additional income via nonclinical work such as medicolegal consulting paid lectures writing etc but you must abide by conflict of interest and conflict of commitment policies

Q If I am on the Clinician Educator tract how will TSL and the output from my TSL affect my Academic Productivity Bonus
A Clinician Educator tract faculty are eligible for the full Academic Productivity Bonus ie no change in criteria or amount due to TSL Failure to use your TSL to achieve your approved goals will not have a negative impact on your Academic Productivity Bonus However if you use your TSL to augment your academic output you may be eligible for earlier promotion and for a higher bonus level according to existing departmental bonus guidelines

Q What will the consequences be if I fail to successfully complete my approved leave of absence plan
A If after careful consideration including an inperson meeting the TSL Committee determines that your TSL was not appropriately used to achieve the approved objectives the Committee may recommend that your next available TSL receive a lower priority or in extreme circumstances be denied

Q How does a TSL affect my clinical target CME time vacation time and supplemental income
A Your clinical target CME time and vacation time will be prorated based on the TSL time granted The average of your FTE for the 3 academic years prior to the date you become eligible for TSL will be used to determine the prorated number of months for your TSL For example if a 3 year 100 FTE is approved for full sabbatical leave you will receive 6 months TSL be expected to work 50 of your original target and have 5 instead of 10 prorated days for CME and 15 instead of 30 prorated vacation days You will also receive only 50 of your academic days during the remainder of the year

Q What happens if I am asked to work during my TSL by the Department
A If you are required to work during your TSL the TSL will be deemed to have been cancelled and your application will be deferred to the following year

Q How will this work if I already have approved days off of clinical service for other activities eg section chief residency activities etc
A If you usually work 100 clinical daysyear and you are approved for a six months sabbatical you would be expected to work 50 clinical days during that year

Q Can I take parental leave and TSL in the same academic year
A Yes but every effort will be made to ensure that time off of clinical service is distributed fairly and equitably and does not place an excessive burden on other members of your section Within reason taking parental leave and TSL in the same academic year will be discouraged and may influence the priority that your TSL receives by the TSL Committee and section chiefs Your TSL may be reduced or deferred accordingly and faculty members may not have more than 6 months leave of absence ie any combination of TSL and paternity leave in any 18 month period

Q Are Vice Chairs eligible for TSL
A Applications from Vice Chairs will not be evaluated by the TSL Committee The Departmental Chair will determine on a case by case basis whether or not a Vice Chair will get a TSL as determined by departmental needs and other considerations If the Chair determines that a TSL is warranted for a Vice Chair it will be coordinated with the TSL Committee and the appropriate section chief

Q Do Vice Chairs have priority over other faculty when applying for TSL
A No

Q Do Full Professors receive priority over Associate Professors
A Not necessarily Every attempt will be made to grant TSL the first time a faculty member is eligible

Q What happens if I am eligible for TSL in an academic year but it is not granted because I am not given the highest priority Do I automatically get highest priority the next year or is it possible that I will again receive lower priority than others and lose my TSL altogether unless the next time I am eligible
A A deferred TSL will be prioritized Thus if someone is unable to take a TSL in year 1 in most instances they will be given priority for the following academic year

Q What happens if there are competing requests for TSL within a clinical section
A Section chiefs will determine priority time allotted and dates for faculty requests for TSL within their section However these must be vetted and approved by the TSL Committee and may be subject to revision by the Committee Any faculty member who believes that their application for TSL is not being treated fairly by a section chief can appeal to the TSL Committee
