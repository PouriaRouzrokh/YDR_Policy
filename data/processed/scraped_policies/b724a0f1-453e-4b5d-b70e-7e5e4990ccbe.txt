This Standard Operating Procedure is to provide guidance to faculty members who convert administrative stipends into time off the clinical service as it relates to their expected clinical day commitment each year The expected clinical days are based on the ladder track but may vary based on administrative responsibilities funded research LOA andor parttime status Each year the number of expected clinical days are set for each faculty member and this information is used by the department leadership to appropriately staff clinical services
1 The replacement cost of clinical shifts is high given that fulltime faculty have considerable embedded fixed costs Replacement costs are not solely covered by the departmental daily rate



B Scope
The document will outline the process that will need to be followed to make a request to relinquish clinical service days related to clinical targets each academic year

2 Faculty whose administrative stipends are used to relinquish time off the clinical service understand that these must be used for academicadministrative work
3 These days may be labelled as academic on the clinical schedule These are not PTO days
