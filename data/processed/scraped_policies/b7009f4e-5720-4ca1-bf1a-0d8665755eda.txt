Purpose

Peer learning supports a culture of learning and minimizing blame Guiding principles are
 All radiologists are encouraged to submit peer feedback
 Feedback is identified by peers and brought back to individual radiologists by a peer learning leader in a respectful fashion to improve their practice
 Peer learning opportunities are presented to sections andor the whole department in an anonymous nonjudgmental manner focused on group learning and clinical improvement

Goal
The goal of peer learning is improvement of services  relying on trust and the free exchange of constructive professional feedback It supports daily work quality patient safety litigation risk reduction and overall learning

Definition of Peer Learning Opportunities
Cases address actual or potential performance issues including discrepancies and great calls and are identified during routine work conferences event reports or other sources



Description of Program Structure and Organization

Roles and Responsibilities

A Peer Learning Program Leaders
   i Director of Peer Learning currently led by the Vice Chair for Quality and Safety
      1 Promote the peer learning program to all radiologists
      2 Develop and maintain peer learning workflows
      3 Train radiologists on expectations and submission processes
      4 Oversee program implementation and identify best practices
      5 Support translation of feedback into quality improvement
      6 Coordinate wholedepartment peer learning conferences
      7 Review the annual peer learning report

   ii Subspecialty Peer Learning Program Managers section delegated leads
      8 Receive and review learning opportunity submissions
      9 Discuss cases with individual radiologists when appropriate
     10 Coordinate development of subspecialty peer learning content
     11 Collaborate with the Vice Chair of Quality and Safety on quality improvement initiatives

B Radiologists
   i Interpret exams with an awareness of learning opportunities
  ii Submit learning opportunities when identified
 iii Engage in peer learning conferences

C Administrative Support
   i Provide logistical support for the program including
      1 Scheduling peer learning conferences
      2 Creating and maintaining records attendance case summaries
      3 Coordinating with the CME coordinator for conference CME approval
      4 Assisting in annual report creation and OPPE case submission data collation
      5 Curating data and slides for conferences
      6 Reporting post conference case outcomes to the hospitals Professional Practice Executive Committee PPEC



Scope

This policy affects all attending clinical radiologists



Materials

 Appendix 1  Primordial Peer Learning Case Submission TIPS Sheet
 Appendix 2  Yale New Health System Radiology OPPE Form



WorkflowParticipation

Meaningful participation in the peer learning program is defined by two components

1 Active Participation in Case Entry
    For full or parttime radiologists excluding IR practitioners a minimum of 24 case entries approximately 2 cases per month on average per academic year July 1st  June 30th is required
    Both learning opportunity and good call cases count toward this requirement see Appendix 1 for instructions
    Cases deemed to offer no learning value may be removed from the participation count Participation is prorated for leaves of absence IR practitioners have no minimal case submission requirement for presentation

2 Attendance
    At least 50 attendance is required at the departmentwide quarterly peer learning conference IRIS for staff in certain divisions neuroradiology cardiothoracic emergency body musculoskeletal pediatric radiology
    For divisions not presenting at IRIS participation in either the departmentwide or sectional peer learningMM conference suffices Sectional meetings should be held quarterly or more frequently at the discretion of the section chiefchampion
    Recorded conferences may be viewed with prior notification to update attendance records



Reporting

 The peer learning content is sequestered from individual performance evaluations Instead participation is noted in the OPPE evaluation for radiologists without generating performance data directly from peer learning submissions
 The Vice Chair of Quality and Safety provides quarterly documentation to the hospitals Professional Practice and Evaluation Committee PPEC including
    Attendance lists
    Details of cases and teaching points
    Potential action plans arising from identified learning opportunities

Quality Improvement
Dedicated efforts are made to translate peer learning findings into quality improvement initiatives with coordinated oversight between the Vice Chair of Quality and Safety and a designated Radiology QI team

Annual Report
A summary of program accomplishments is generated from the peer learning database including
   1 Total number of exams submitted as peer learning opportunities or good calls
   2 Percentage of radiologists meeting attendance requirements
   3 Percentage of radiologists meeting submission requirements
   4 List of quality improvement activities linked to peer learning discussions

Appendix 1  Primordial Peer Learning Case Entry

This appendix outlines the process for submitting peer learning cases via the Primordial Communicator App

1 Launch a study on the workstation with Visage and access the Peer Learning Software using the Primordial Communicator App Note The old Peervue software will be retired

2 In the Communicator select the Create New list and click on Peer Learning

3 In Step 1
   a Choose the appropriate case typically a prior exam
   b Adjust the Identified By field if necessary default is Radiologist
   c Select the correct section corresponding to the radiologist who interpreted the case

4 Click Next to proceed to Step 2

5 In Step 2
    Enter comments under the Description tab text is mandatory even for Good Call cases
    Optional tabs for Clinical History and Clinical Follow may be filled out if desired
    Features such as Capture Region Capture Window and clipboard paste for screenshots may be included in future updates

6 At the bottom select one of the following options
   a Learning Opportunity  for cases with potential learning value that count toward the participation requirement
   b Good Call  for commendable case evaluations that also count toward the requirement
   c For Discussion  flags a case for potential sectional discussion these do not count toward participation requirements

Upon submission the case will be forwarded to the sectional Peer Learning Champion or Section Chief If the case is approved as a learning opportunity an email with case details will be sent to the interpreting radiologist
