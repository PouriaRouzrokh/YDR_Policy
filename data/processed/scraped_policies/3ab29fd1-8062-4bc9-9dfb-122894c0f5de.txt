Radiology Tips Requesting Formal Interpretation of Outside Imaging Studies

Radiologists working in the Yale Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging YDR can issue a formal interpretation with a report placed in Epic for studies performed at facilities not covered by YDR Currently all radiology sites affiliated with YNHHSRC Milford Hospital and Bridgeport Hospital OutPatient Radiology are staffed by YDR

Official interpretation of outside imaging by YDR offers a second opinion to patients with interpretation by a tertiary care center subspecialized Radiologist Published data has shown that such programs decrease costs reduce radiation exposure caused by repeat exams and frequently result in alteration in diagnosis and clinical management

Your patients insurance company will be billed a professional fee for the secondary interpretation by a YDR radiologist
