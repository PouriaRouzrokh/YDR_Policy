| Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging | SOP 8.00 | Effective Date: <br> March 2022 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Title: Continuing Medical Education | Version 4 | RAD Mission: Clinical |
| Prepared By: Regina Hooley, MD |  | March 2022 |
| Approval: Rob Goodman, MD |  | March 2022 |

# A. Purpose 

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the YDR policy for using continuing medical education (CME) and conference time. Faculty may enroll in virtual courses, but are strongly encouraged to attend subspecialty oriented courses. Faculty on the Clinical Educator track should not use CME/conference time to attend virtual meetings if possible, as CE faculty need to go to meetings, give talks, garner a national reputation, mentor junior faculty and promote Yale.

## B. Scope

This SOP applies to all clinical YDR faculty.

## C. Procedures

1. All clinical faculty should attend CME courses each year to fulfill CT license requirements.
2. CT license requirements: " A licensed physician applying for renewal shall earn a minimum of fifty contact hours of qualifying continuing medical education within the preceding twenty-four month period. One contact hour means a minimum of fifty minutes of continuing education activity." CMEs must also include 1-2 hours of specific training.
3. Virtual CME
   a. Taking CME days to "attend" a virtual course or to review archived courses is dependent upon adequate clinical coverage similar to attendance at all meetings and is at the discretion of the division/section chief.
   b. Expenses other than registration or purchase of course materials cannot be charged to staff accounts.
4. Faculty are given 10 days of CME each year and these are included in PTO days 
   a. CE faculty may take more than 10 conference days, using allotted academic time with approval from their division/section chief.

5. CME/conference hotel expenses should not exceed $500 / night (inclusive of taxes and fees). Anything over $500/night (net including taxes) requires pre-authorization by the Chair's office.
6. Receipts submitted over $500 submitted without pre-authorization will not be fully approved and reimbursement will be capped at $500.
