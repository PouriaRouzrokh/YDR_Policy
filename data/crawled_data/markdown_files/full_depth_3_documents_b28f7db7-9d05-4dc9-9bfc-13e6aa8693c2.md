# A. Purpose 

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the Department of Radiology/YDR phased retirement (PR) guidelines.

## B. Scope

This SOP follows University guidelines. Phased retirement applies to eligible ladder faculty who may reduce their workload by $50 \%$ in their three years of phased retirement without an equivalent drop in income in the first two years. Electing the Faculty PR is a final decision which cannot be revoked.

## C. Materials

Appendix at end of this document.

## D. Procedures

1. Eligible faculty
a. Must elect to participate between their $65^{\text {th }}$ and $70^{\text {th }}$ birthday

- Faculty may begin the program as early as the January or July following their 65th birthday, but no later than July 1 following their 70th birthday.
- Faculty should inform the Chair's office of their intent to begin the program at least 6 months in advance.
b. Have 10 or more years of continuous service
c. Have the following appointments: Professor or Associate Professor with tenure

2. Salary and workload
a. At the start of phased retirement, eligible faculty would reduce their workload to $50 \%$ for up to three years-receiving $100 \%$ salary in year one, $75 \%$ of salary in year two, and $50 \%$ of salary in year three.
b. Faculty members may retire fully after year one or two and must retire no later than the end of year three.
3. Clinical Schedule
a. Faculty in PR, in coordination with the Chair/Chair's office and division/section chief, may choose to retain their regular workload for half the year and take the other 6 months completely off.
b. Alternatively, faculty may reduce their workload by $50 \%$ over the course of the

year.

- The exact clinical schedule should be decided in co-ordination with the Chair's office and division/section chief to avoid disrupting patient care, research, or trainee supervision for an extended period of time. PR faculty should determine their clinical schedule in advance of the academic year and should not expect to select clinical work days on a month-to-month basis.
- PR faculty are not expected to work over the reduced clinical target
- If PR faculty wish to work over clinical target, they should expect to share the additional shifts equally among other faculty in their section who also wish to work over their clinical target, as per academic appointment.
- PR faculty show enter time away in Qgenda.


# 4. Administrative Roles 

Administrative roles may be reassigned at the discretion of the Chair. PR faculty may be asked to retain their administrative role during the $1^{\text {st }} \mathrm{PR}$ year. During the transition PR period, PR faculty are expected to serve as mentors to incoming faculty with similar administrative roles
5. Triennial/Sabbatical Leave (TSL)

Faculty on phased retirement get one triennial leave - for the full leave period but at the salary percentage designated for that year.

- Except for leaves granted for child care, care giving, or public service, a Triennial Leave may not be combined with any other leave, paid or unpaid, to make up a leave of absence for a full academic year. b.

6. Other
a. Office space - PR faculty who request an office will be assigned office space. However, they may be asked to give up their original primary office depending on YDR demand and at the request of the Chair's office.
b. PTO - Vacation and CME will not be tracked, and may be entered in Qgenda as vacation, CME or "off days".
c. Staff account - PR faculty will be eligible for the standard YDR yearly staff account.

# Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging Triennial/Sabbatical Leave of Absence (TSL) Policy for ClinicalFaculty 

## Objectives

Provide TSL to all clinical faculty (Clinical and Clinician Educator tracts) at the Associate Professor and Full Professor rank working 100\% FTE with opportunities:

1. forprofessional growth and developmentso thatthey may serve more effectively in theirfield of specialization and/or in their academic pursuits.
2. to stepbackfrom clinical duties in orderto help restore/maintainenergy, stamina and enthusiasm.

## TSL Application and Approval Process

1. The Triennnial/Sabbatical Leave of Absence (TSL) Committee will be a standing committee in the Yale Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging.
a. Members will be appointed by the Departmental Chair.
b. Itwillconsistofaseniorfaculty memberChairand upto six additionalfaculty members representing assistant, associate and full professors within the departmenton both Clinical and Clinician Educator tracts.

c. There are no set term limits, but membership (including number of members) are subject to change at the discretion of the Departmental Chair.
d. TheCommittee will meetas often as necessary tofulfill theneeds of the department and faculty.
2. The TSL Committee will review TSL applications to certify that an individual's leave of absence plan and amount of time requested is appropriate to meet to the objectives of TSL.
3. The TSL Committee will review TSL applications with the relevant section chiefs to: (1) verify that service needs will be met during the TSL withoutaninordinate burden on other members of the section, and (2) ensure thatprioritization and allocation is fair and appropriate, especially in the event that multiple members of a section are eligible for TSL in the same academic year.
4. Leave requests that require uninterrupted blocks of time will be prioritized over those spread out over the approval.

# TSL Details 

1. Leave may be requested in uninterrupted 1 month blocks of time during the single academic year within which it was approved but if this is not feasible, leave may be spread out over the approval period.
2. Faculty will not be eligible for Y-payments unless they work above their regular clinical commitment.
3. Parental leave of absence, as mandated by the University, will have priority over TSL.
4. TSL may be limited, changed, and/or postponed based on departmental and sectional clinical needs. Although the department will strive to accommodate all appropriate requests, everyone may not receive the same amount of time for TSL.

## Deliverables

1. Withinonemonthofcompletion ofaTSL, thefacultymemberwillprovideaonepage summary to the TSL Committee that delineates how they used their TSL to meet the approved plan for their leave of absence.
2. Faculty may also be requested to meet with the TSL Committee (and possibly other invitees) to describe how their TSL helped them meet their approved leave of absence plan.

## FAQs

Q. What does the faculty handbook say about TSL?
A. University guidance states the following:

- It is a privilege and not a right.
- It is awarded for periods up to 4 months (triennial) and up to 6 months (sabbatical).
- It should be taken in blocks of at least 1 month.
- For accounting purposes, TSL must be taken in the period for which it is approved (Jan thru June - for Jan 1st eligibility, July thru June - for July $1^{\text {st }}$ eligibility).
- Iftheapplicantis unable to take the TSL in the year awarded, it may be deferred and will be given priority in the subsequent year
- Iftheapplicanttakes onlyaportion ofthe TSL during the year awarded, the remaining time may not roll over into subsequent years

Q. What factors will be considered in the TSL approval process?
A. The TSL Committee will take into account the following:

- Purpose and merits of the submitted leave of absence plan
- Time needed to execute the plan
- Time since previous TSL
- Other TSLs requested concurrently within the applicant's clinical section
- Other leaves of absence (parental, sick, administrative, phased retirement) within the applicant's clinical section
- The amount of additional work to be covered by applicant's colleagues during their absence.
Q. Can I augment my income during my TSL?
A. During your TSL, no additional income may be derived from working clinically through your leave. Income from TIMC, moonlighting shifts and paid call will be allowed.
Q. Does this mean that I could have decreased net income during my TSL?
A. If you augment your income with other departmental activities, you may not be able to earn this additionalincomeduringyourTSL. However, youwillstillbeeligibleforyourfullClinicalProductivity Bonus (Clinical tract) or Academic Productivity Bonus (Clinician Educator tract), regardless of the length of your approvedTSL.
Q. Is there any way to make up for lost income during my TSL?
A. Your TSL is intended to provide you with an opportunity for professional growth and development, and also to "recharge your batteries". Nevertheless, you may earn additional income via non-clinical work, such as medicolegal, consulting, paid lectures, writing, etc., butyou mustabide by conflict of interest and conflict of commitment policies.
Q. If I am on the Clinician Educator tract, how will TSL and the output from my TSL affect my Academic Productivity Bonus?
A. Clinician Educator tract faculty are eligible for the full Academic Productivity Bonus (i.e. no change in criteria or amountdue to TSL). Failure to use your TSL to achieveyour approved goals will not havea negative impact on your Academic Productivity Bonus. However, if you use your TSL to augment your academicoutput, you may be eligible for earlier promotion and for a higher bonus level according to existing departmental bonus guidelines.
Q. Whatwilltheconsequences beifI fail to successfully complete my approvedleave of absence plan? A. If, after careful consideration, including an in-person meeting, the TSL Committee determines that your TSL was not appropriately used to achieve the approved objectives, the Committee may recommend thatyournextavailableTSL receivealower priority or, in extreme circumstances, be denied.

Q. How does a TSL affect my clinical target, CME time, vacation time, and supplemental income?
A. Your clinical target, CME time and vacation time will be prorated based on the TSL time granted. The average of your \%FTE for the 3 academic years prior to the date you become eligible for TSL will be used to determine the prorated number of months for your TSL. For example, if a 3 year 100\% FTE is approved for full sabbatical leave, they will receive 6 months TSL, be expected to work 50\% of their original target, and have 5 (instead of 10) prorated) days for CME and 15 (instead of 30) prorated vacation days. They will also receive only $50 \%$ of their academic days during the remainder of the year.
Q. What happens if I am asked to work during my TSL by the Department?
A. If you are required to work during your TSL, the TSL will be deemed to have been cancelled, and your application will be deferred to the following year.
Q. How will thiswork iflalready have approved days offof clinical service for other activities (eg. section chief, residency activities, etc)?
A. If you usually work 100 clinical days/year and you are approved for a six months sabbatical, you would be expected to work 50 clinical days during that year.
Q. Can I take parental leave and TSL in the same academic year?
A. Yes, but every effort will be made to make certain that time off of clinical service is distributed fairly and equitably and does not place an excessive burden on other members of yoursection. So, within reason, taking parental leave and TSL in the same academic year will be discouraged and may influence the priority that your TSL receives by the TSL Committee and section chiefs. Your TSL may be reduced or deferred accordingly, and faculty members may not have more than 6 months leave of absence (i.e. any combination of TSL and paternity leave) in any 18 month period.
Q. Are Vice Chairs eligible for TSL?
A. Applications from Vice Chairs will not be evaluated by the TSL Committee. The Departmental Chair will determine on a case by case basis whether or not a Vice Chair will get a TSL as determined by departmental needs and other considerations. If the Chair determines that a TSL is warranted for a Vice Chair, it will be coordinated with the TSL Committee and the appropriate section chief.
Q. Do Vice Chairs have priority over other faculty when applying for TSL?
A. No.
Q. Do Full Professors receive priority over Associate Professors?
A. Not necessarily. Every attempt will be made to grant TSL the firsttime a faculty member is eligible.
Q. What happensiflameligibleforTSLin an academic year, butitis not granted becauseitis notgiven the highest priority? Do I automatically get highest priority the next year, or is it possible that I will again receive lower priority than others and lose my TSL altogether unless the nexttime lameligible?
A. A deferred TSL will be prioritized. Thus, if someone is unable to take a TSL in year 1, in most instances they will be given priority for the following academic year.
Q. What happens if there are competing requests for TSL within a clinical section?

A. Section chiefs will determine priority, time allotted, and dates forfaculty requests for TSL within their section. However, these must be vetted and approved by the TSL Committee and may be subjectto revision by the Committee. Anyfacultymember who believes that their application for TSL is notbeing treated fairly by a section chief can appeal to the TSL Committee.
