# Radiology Tips: Requesting Formal Interpretation of Outside Imaging Studies 

Radiologists working in the Yale Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging (YDR) can issue a formal interpretation with a report placed in Epic for studies performed at facilities not covered by YDR. Currently all radiology sites affiliated with YNHH/SRC, Milford Hospital and Bridgeport Hospital OutPatient Radiology are staffed by YDR.

Official interpretation of outside imaging by YDR offers a second opinion to patients with interpretation by a tertiary care center sub-specialized Radiologist. Published data has shown that such programs decrease costs, reduce radiation exposure caused by repeat exams, and frequently result in alteration in diagnosis and clinical management.

Your patient's insurance company will be billed a professional fee for the secondary interpretation by a YDR radiologist.

## What types of studies can be nominated for an official second read:

1. Must be an MRI, CT, PET-CT. All forms of breast imaging are also eligible (mammogram, ultrasound, MRI).
2. Must be less than 90 days old. Do not place requests for outside reads on exams older than 90 days (they will automatically be canceled by YDR Image Library staff except in specific clinical circumstances at discretion of radiologist). Images not eligible for outside interpretation will still be uploaded/viewable in our PACS.

## Sites eligible for outside reads:

Any hospital/site including Smilow Cancer Center affiliated sites (ex. St. Francis) where the original interpretation is not completed by a YDR Radiologist. This includes exams performed at other Yale-New Haven Health System facilities including Bridgeport Hospital (main campus), Greenwich Hospital, Lawrence and Memorial, and Westerly Hospital. In-patient exams are eligible if the patient is transferred to YNHH or if request is placed after patient discharge (see exception \#3 below for further information).

## Sites not eligible

1. Bridgeport Hospital Outpatient Radiology locations, including Park Avenue Medical Center, and Milford Hospital are NOT eligible for second reads as exams are interpreted by YDR radiologists.
2. Any exam performed at a Veterans (VA) health system site is NOT eligible secondary to insurance limitations and VA Radiologist affiliation with Yale Radiology.
3. Second reads for imaging exams on in-patients at other YNHHS hospitals (ex. Bridgeport, Greenwich etc) while they are still hospitalized at the other site are not eligible.

## To request an outside read:

## Best Method

1. Upload the exam via Powershare software (available on every clinical workstation) and choose nominate for second read/official interpretation option. Powershare can receive images electronically from many other institutions or pull images from CD-ROM.

2. Carefully complete the patient clinical details and requesting MD's contact information.
3. Co-sign the request for the imaging order in your Epic In-basket.
4. Only request an outside read for the most recent examinations. Example- if your patient has multiple CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis exams and PET-CTs, only request most recent exam for official read. Older exams should still be uploaded but will be used for comparison when interpreting most recent study.

# Alternative Methods 

1. Disc may be dropped off at the Image Library for upload. An order can be placed via paper form with Image Library.
2. For images already uploaded into our PACS (can be seen in patient imaging tab in EPIC) that are in a OSF status, outside read request can also be requested via EPIC by typing "outside" in EPIC order search bar and selecting the correct study type. Request can also be sent via email to our Image Library team at radiologycustomerservice@ynhh.org. You must provide details on which exact study you are requesting an outside read on, relevant clinical history/reason for consult, and authorizing/ordering provider name and contact information.

Tumor board and multi-disciplinary conference cases must follow the same upload and ordering procedure as described above. Please submit these cases 2-3 days in advance of the conference.

## Additional details:

If inadequate clinical history is available, or image quality is poor/incomplete the radiologist has freedom to not issue formal report for the requested study.

Errors in entered exam information will lead to interpretation delays or cancelation. Orders placed via EPIC with no corresponding images uploaded will be canceled after 72 hours.
"Curbside consults" will not be provided for CT, MRI or PET-CT exams that are eligible for the outside read program.
