1.0 Purpose

Because there is no current departmental procedure for NIH publication costs, the purpose of this document is to provide support for the growing cost of these.

Open Access requirements for NIH grant funded publications now require sizeable publication costs. While these can be charged to grants, many publications are accepted once the grant funding period is over and award funding is no longer available.

2.0 Scope

This standard operating procedure (SOP) sets out the requirements for the appropriate management of publication costs. This SOP provides Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging faculty and staff with guidelines to follow for payment for publication costs.

# 3.0 Procedures:

A departmental publication fund will be created for FY23. Faculty who have no other resource for publication funding (startups, dowries, discretionary funds, staff accounts etc) may apply to the VC for Scientific Research for access to the fund. Once the fund is depleted, no additional monies will be made available. The fund will be replenished at the start of each academic year. Each faculty member should not be expected to exceed funding from this source in excess of $4,000 / year.
