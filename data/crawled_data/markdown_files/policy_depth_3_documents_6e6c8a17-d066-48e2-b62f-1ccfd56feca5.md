# PURPOSE 

To provide guidelines for the use of intravenous or oral, iodinated and gadolinium based contrast media, as well as the proper response of Radiology staff in the event of a contrast media event.

## RESPONSIBILITY

1. IV and oral contrast media agents are considered medications according to the Joint Commission and, therefore, all adherences to the Medication Management Standards and all applicable YNHH drug use policies apply.
2. The patient's physician, PA, or APRN is responsible to order radiology exams, including those that require contrast media, either by written requisition or via computer order entry system. Inpatient and ED requests for contrast exams must include the patient's pregnancy status and renal function as appropriate.
3. The radiologist has primary responsibility to review pertinent, available patient history, including eGFR levels when applicable, and the appropriateness of the request for contrast media. The dose and the type of contrast administered will usually be pre-assigned per protocol performed.
4. Per YDR and DR administration, the responsibility to protocol CT exams with contrast is limited to radiology physicians and/or advanced practitioners, unless exam is eligible for autoprotocol. For exams ordered with IV contrast, the patient's eGFR should be ≥ 30. If the eGFR is < 30, follow the low eGFR workflow as follows:
   a. eGFR results for inpatient and ED patients should be within 48 hours. All inpatients and ED patients require a results value in order to proceed with contrast administration unless exam is eligible for eGFR bypass.
   b. Any outpatient answering "Yes" to a renal risk factor question on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire requires a renal function assessment. Outpatients without risk factors do not require renal testing prior to receiving IV contrast. A Point of Care (POC) eGFR test is provided if no eGFR value is available within 6 weeks in Epic. eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist.
5. All personnel involved in the administration of contrast media must be aware of the steps to anticipate a contrast reaction, to prevent it or, if one occurs, to recognize it and take appropriate measures. (See Addendum 1.15A Recognition and Response to Contrast Reaction.)

# 6. eGFR Workflow and Responsibilities for CT 

a. For CT studies ordered WITH contrast and eGFR over 30, the exam can be protocoled with IV contrast.

b. For CT studies ordered with a Life/Limb Threatening priority, full trauma, or a stroke code, eGFR testing is not required prior to imaging.

c. For CT studies ordered WITH contrast and eGFR below 30 when the patient arrives:
   i. The technologist will call the appropriate reading room to notify a radiologist, who then reviews the case and decides how to proceed:
      1. Give contrast despite eGFR <30: If in doubt, discuss with the ordering provider and document the reasoning in the report.
      2. Change to CT WITHOUT contrast: If the clinical question can be answered without IV contrast, document the change. The technologist should:
         a. Place a 52 Modifier on the exam and e-mail 52Limited.Imaging@ynhh.org describing the rationale for changing to a noncontrast exam.
      3. Cancel/reschedule the exam: If canceled, the Clinical Scheduling Assistant (CSA) notes the cancel reason as "lab function out of range" in Epic order history.
   ii. The technologist documents the name of the radiologist who made the decision in the Epic study notes.
   iii. If the order is changed or canceled, the technologist communicates the decision to the CSA, who then contacts the ordering physician's office using an approved script. If the ordering provider disagrees, the CSA connects them with the radiologist for further discussion.
      - For CT WITHOUT contrast:
         1. Epic Provider:
            a. The CSA changes the order in Epic to a noncontrast exam and sends an in-basket request for co-sign.
            b. The CSA tracks the order to ensure the co-sign is received.
         2. Non-Epic Provider:
            a. The CSA changes the order in Epic to a noncontrast exam.
            b. The CSA requests a new requisition from the ordering physician and tracks its receipt.
            c. The new requisition is uploaded into the Media Manager section of Epic.
         3. The CSA contacts PFAS (PFASDrChanges@ynhh.org) to alert the pre-service team of the change in procedure code, and then tracks each order code via the change order excel.
      - For exam cancellation:
         1. CSA cancels the appointment in Epic and follows direction from the ordering physician's office regarding rescheduling.
      - If the CSA cannot reach the ordering physician, the radiologist's decision prevails, with documentation of the rationale.

# PROCEDURE GUIDELINES FOR INTRAVENOUS (IV) CONTRAST 

1. IV contrast will be injected through an established IV line (by a nurse or technologist). Refer to DR Policy Medication Administration by Technologists in Diagnostic Radiology.
2. Prior to IV contrast administration, review the patient's history (including medications, allergies, and renal impairment screening) via the medical record or outpatient questionnaire.
   a. If no contraindications exist, proceed with the IV contrast administration as per the radiologist’s protocol.
   b. If contraindications are noted, refer the case to the radiologist.
   c. The IV line remains in place during the exam in case IV drug therapy is needed.
   d. A physician, APP, or RN must be on site during contrast administration.
   e. A contrast reaction kit and emergency equipment (e.g., code cart at hospital sites) must be immediately available.

3. Point of Care testing is performed by the technologist or nursing staff (mostly for outpatients). The test, inspected by the College of American Pathologists, measures creatinine in whole blood. eGFR may be calculated by the meter or via the EHR to assess renal function.
4. The Point of Care meter is maintained by the MRI and CT scan departments in line with a strict QA schedule, with staff training and annual competency reviews conducted by the Department of Laboratory Medicine.
5. Point of Care Renal Function Testing in Radiology:
   a. MRI Patients: See the MRI safety manual for full details.
   b. CT Patients: Outpatients answering "Yes" to contrast-related questions on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire receive point of care testing if no eGFR/Cr value is available within 6 weeks. eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist (as detailed above).

# For Planned Administration of Contrast Agents:

Previous reaction to allergens (e.g., shellfish, peanuts, medications, etc):

Mild | Moderate | Severe
--- | --- | ---
None | None | None

Previous reaction to the same class of contrast agent to be given:

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | Pre-medicate and use a different agent | Do not give contrast* |

Previous reaction to a different class of contrast agent than the type planned:

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | None | None |

*Unless, in the opinion of the responsible health care professional and supervising radiologist, the benefits outweigh the risks (e.g., in emergency situations). In such cases, the clinical provider should accompany the patient to the radiology suite (whenever feasible) to aid in management if a repeat reaction occurs.

Premedication with steroids and Benadryl is now recommended only for patients with a prior reaction to the same class of contrast agent (iodinated for CT and gadolinium-based for MRI). Prophylaxis for reactions to other allergens is no longer necessary.

This guideline is based on the following information:

- Estimated overall reaction risk in the general population is less than 1% (approximately 0.2-0.6%) (Wang et al., Dillman et al.)
- Patients with a prior reaction to the same class of contrast agent are at the highest risk for a repeat reaction, with a 3-11% overall reaction rate and a 2% breakthrough reaction rate despite pre-medication during CT (Mervak et al., Lasser et al.).
- The current standard of care in the United States is pre-medication with steroids and antihistamines to reduce the risk of repeat reactions in patients with prior reactions to a similar class of contrast agent.
- An IV steroid regimen (recommended below) is considered non-inferior to a longer oral regimen and is therefore recommended in ED and in-patient settings to expedite imaging when needed (Mervak et al.).

# Exclusions 

- In certain clinical circumstances, the urgency of a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI may override the benefits of fully executing the premedication protocol. In such cases, contrast medium may be administered without premedication or with a modified protocol. This determination should be made jointly by the supervising radiologist and ordering clinician (and the patient, if feasible), with proper documentation in the medical record.

## Allergic Like Reaction Definitions [1]:

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Limited urticaria/pruritis [2] | Diffuse urticaria/pruritis | Diffuse edema, or facial edema with dyspnea |
| Nasal congestion | Diffuse erythema, stable vital signs | Diffuse erythema with hypotension |
| Cutaneous edema | Facial edema without dyspnea | Laryngeal edema with stridor and/or hypoxia |
| Sneezing/conjunctivitis/rhinorrhea | Throat tightness or hoarseness without dyspnea | Wheezing/bronchospasm, significant hypoxia |
| Limited "itchy"/"scratchy" throat | Wheezing/bronchospasm, mild or no hypoxia | Anaphylactic shock (hypotension + tachycardia) |

[^0]
[^0]:    [1] Physiologic reactions such as nausea, vomiting, or a feeling of warmth are unlikely to benefit from pre-medication.
           [2] If the urticaria/pruritis required medical treatment, it should be considered moderate in severity.
