# Accessibility at Yale

## Accessibility Statement at YSM

Copy Link

As part of [Yale’s mission](https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/mission-statement), Yale is committed to “the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community.” That diversity includes all people regardless of ability or disability.

Websites and web applications are integral to the university’s academic and administrative work. Yale is committed to making information, programs and activities on its websites and web applications accessible to people with disabilities through its [Web Accessibility Policy](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/1605-web-accessibility-policy).

The Web Accessibility Policy applies to websites and applications that conduct university business, including all Yale School of Medicine, Yale School of Public Health, and Yale Cancer Center websites. Owners of such sites should be familiar with this policy and the [Web Accessibility Procedure](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/procedures/1605-pr01-web-accessibility-procedure). The policy may also affect people in roles that work on university websites. People in roles that work on University websites and web applications should explore this website and take advantage of [Yale’s accessibility resources and trainings](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles).

## Why is this policy important?

This policy supports Yale’s mission to disseminate knowledge and promote diversity and inclusion throughout our community.

The web is a primary source of information for just about everyone. This policy is one step toward making Yale’s web content more accessible to everyone—including the almost 20% of U.S. citizens who have some form of disability. For example, testing our websites with assistive technologies allows us to improve the content to work with screen reader technology often used by those who are visually impaired.

## How does this impact us at YSM?

We need to be sure that we are working toward making all Yale School of Medicine websites, including Yale Medicine, Yale Cancer, Center and Yale School of Public Health, more accessible according to the standards set by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).

The policy states:

* After March 1, 2018, all new content entered into any YSM sites must be accessible.
* After September 1, 2018, all new websites or websites that undergo substantial revisions or redesign must be accessible.
* After September 1, 2018, if an outside vendor is used to create a website, the website owner must assure that the vendor delivers accessible technology. In addition, current websites provided by outside vendors may be required to be made accessible.

The details of this policy are on the [Web Accessibility Policy page.](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/1605-web-accessibility-policy)
