Magnetic Resonance Imaging is an ever changing, evolving technology. There are potential risks in the MR environment, not only for the patient but also for the accompanying family members, attending health care professionals and others who find themselves only occasionally or rarely in the magnetic fields of MR scanners, such as security, housekeeping personnel, firefighters, police, etc. This manual has been developed to help guide the MR staff regarding these issues.

The policies written in this manual are guidelines to follow as a standard of care throughout the Yale New Haven Health system MRI departments. It is at the discretion of the supervising radiology attending to divert from any policy in an emergency situation. Please refer to page 101 "Exceptions of MR safety policies" for further detail.

It is the intent of the Yale New Haven Hospital safety manual to:

- Protect and educate all patients, direct and ancillary personal about the possible risks, associated with the MR Suite including but not limited to static, time-varying magnetic fields and RF pulses.
- To be in compliance with the most up to date MR safety information provided by the Joint Commission and the ACR
- Prove helpful as the field of MRI continues to evolve and mature, providing MR services that are among the most powerful, yet safest, of all diagnostic procedures to be developed in the history of modern medicine.

The MR task group of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International has developed a set of MR safety terms. This terminology is NOT being applied retrospectively to implants and devices that previously received FDA approved labeling using the terms "MR safe" or "MR compatible". This applies to those objects tested prior to December 2005.

Particularly with regard to nonclinical and incidental equipment, current products marketed with ill-defined terminology such as "nonmagnetic", or the outdated classifications described above ("MR compatible"), should NOT be presumed to conform to a particular current ASTM classification.

To go along with the new terminology, the ASTM introduced corresponding icons consistent with international standards for colors and shapes of safety signs. They are intended for use on items that may be brought into or near the MRI environment as well as in product labeling.

- MR SAFE - is an item that poses no known hazards in all MRI environments. Using the new terminology, "MR Safe" items include non-conducting, nonmetallic, non-magnetic items such as a plastic Petri dish. The "MR Safe" icon consists of the of the letters "MR" in green in a white square with a green border or - the letters "MR" in white in a green square.
- MR CONDITIONAL - is an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a specified MR environment as long as specified conditions of use are met. The "MR Conditional" icon consists of the letter "MR" in black inside a yellow triangle with a black border. The item labeling must include the results of testing and the specific conditions of use sufficient to characterize the behavior of the item in the MRI environment.
- MR UNSAFE - is an item that is known to pose hazards in all MRI environments. MR Unsafe items include magnetic items such as a pair of ferromagnetic scissors. The "MR Unsafe" icon consists of the letters "MR" in black in a white field inside a red circle with a diagonal red band.
- Safety in MRI Not Evaluated- For devices that have historically not provided any information about MRI safety

The ACR established the 4 zone concept as defined in the ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices: 2007. The four zone concept provides for progressive restrictions in access to the MRI scanner. All MRI Suites are marked with Zone signs

- Zone I: General public freely accessible to the public. This area is typically outside the MR environment.
- Zone II: Limited Access: This is the Zone located between the public uncontrolled Zone 1 and the strictly controlled Zone 3. This area has limited access - available to patients, family members and hospital personnel who have been safety trained or safety screened by Level 2 MR personnel. It is in Zone II that the answers to MR screening questions, patient histories, medical insurance questions, etc. are typically obtained.

![img-1.jpeg](images/img-1.jpeg.png)

- Zone III: The MR scanner (Zone 4) itself is located adjacent to this space. Zone III can be defined as regions from which potentially hazardous energies (related to the MR imaging process) may be accessed. Zone III regions should be physically restricted from general public access by, for example, key locks, passkey locking systems, or any other reliable, physically restricting method. Only MR personnel shall be provided free access, such as the access keys or passkeys, to Zone III. Patients, family members, or hospital staff that has undergone safety screening or safety training will be allowed access to this area only when accompanied by appropriate MR personnel.
- Zone IV: Is the room housing the MR scanner itself. Zone IV should also be demarcated and clearly marked as being potentially hazardous due to the presence of very strong magnetic fields. Zone IV, by definition, will always be located within Zone III as it is the MR magnet and its associated magnetic field which generates the existence of Zone III. Only patients and family members, or hospital staff accompanied by Level 2 MR personnel who have undergone safety screening or safety training will be admitted to this Zone.

![img-2.jpeg](images/img-2.jpeg.png)

Non-MR Personnel should be accompanied by, or under the immediate supervision of and visual contact with, one specifically identified MR person for the entirety of their duration within Zone III and a level 2 MR person in Zone IV restricted regions.

| MRI Safety Manual | SUBJECT: TIME VARYING GRADIENT MAGNETIC |  |  |
|  | FIELD-RELATED ISSUES |  |  |

The time varying magnetic fields in MRI produce auditory, induced voltage and thermal issues that we should be aware of.

# Induced Voltage Considerations: 

Implanted wires pose a possibility of creating a current along the wire inside the MRI

- Patients with implanted wires in anatomically and/or functionally sensitive area should be considered at a higher risk. The decision to perform imaging and/or limit the rate of magnetic field change and strength of the magnetic field should be reviewed by the radiologist supervising the case.


## Thermal Considerations:

SAR-Specific Absorption Rate is defined as the RF power absorbed per unit of mass of an object. It is measured in watts per kilogram ( $\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{kg}$ ). The SAR describes the potential for heating of the patient's tissues due to application of the RF necessary to produce the MR signal. Technologists will monitor SAR levels introduced to the patient, and will stay within appropriate levels. Electric currents can be created during MR imaging which could cause burns to the patient.

- All electrical connections such as surface coil leads, monitoring devices, etc., must be physically checked by the scanning technologist before beginning the scan to ensure the integrity of the thermal and electrical insulation.
- All unnecessary or unused electrically conductive materials external to the patient should be completely removed from the MR system before scanning starts.
- For electrically conductive material, wires, leads, implants, etc., that are required to remain in the bore of the magnet with the patient during imaging, pads, etc. should be placed between the patient and the electrically conductive material during imaging to keep the electrical conductor from directly contacting the patient. Pads can also be placed between the conductive material and the wall of the magnet if the body coil is being used, no loops should be created.
- Care is needed to ensure that the patients' tissues do not directly come into contact with the inner bore if the scanner during the imaging process. Pads should be placed between the patient and the magnet walls. It is also important to ensure that the patients' own tissues do not form large conductive loops. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure that the patients' arms and legs not be positioned in such a way as to form a loop within the bore of the magnet.
- There have been rare reports of thermal injuries/burns associated with clothing that contained electrically conductive materials, such as metallic threads and silver impregnated clothing. As such, all patients remove their own clothing and instead change into provided gowns.

- All unconscious/unresponsive patients should have attached leads insulated from their skin during scanning.
- It is important to follow established product MR Conditional labeling and safety guidelines carefully and precisely, applying them to and only to the static magnetic field strengths at which they had been tested. MR scanning at either stronger and/or weaker magnetic field strengths than those tested may result in significant heating where none had been observed at the tested field strength(s).
- The patient should immediately report any burning/or discomfort to the MR technologist, the scan should be stopped and the situation accessed. A RL solution should be documented by the technologist via the Intranet and to the FDA Maude website if any equipment was involved www.fda.gov/medwatch


# Auditory Considerations: 

Patients ALWAYS need to have hearing protection as well as their family members who accompany them into the scan room. Please review our Ear plug policy below.

| POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL |  |  |  |
| MRI Safety Manual | SUBJECT: EAR PLUGS DURING AN MRI EXAM |  |  |

# MRI Imaging with Ear Plugs: 

The noise generated by scanning may reach a level in the scan room and in the bore of the magnet that can result in temporary (and occasionally) permanent hearing loss. Properly inserted earplugs will limit the level of the noise that reach the inner ear. Any patient who undergoes an MRI, as well as anyone in Zone 4 during a scan, MUST wear earplugs.*

The earplugs will be inserted by the MRI staff. The earplugs are Latex Free and have an acceptable NNR rating.

In pediatric patients, and patients with unusual shaped ear canals, the earplugs may not fit properly to limit the noise level. In these instances, MRI staff will use another form of hearing protection such as headphones or ear muffs that will hold the earplugs in place and further dampen the noise level.

If a patient has their own custom ear plugs, designed for their ear canals it is acceptable to use after they have been wanded for metal. MR staff need to check they are inserted.
*A patient who is deaf in one or both ears, does not need to use hearing protection in the affected ear canal. Please document in EPIC

| POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL |  |  |  |
| MRI Safety Manual | SUBJECT: FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS |  |  |

A.) All MR sites should arrange to prospectively educate their local fire marshals, police and security personnel about the potential hazards of responding to emergencies in the MR suite.
B.) It should be stressed that even in the presence of a fire or other emergency the magnetic field may be present and fully operational. Free access to Zone IV by firefighters and other non-MRI personnel with air tanks, axes, crowbars, guns, etc. can prove to be catastrophic or even lethal. Helium is not flammable and does not pose a fire hazard directly; however, the liquid oxygen that can result from the super cooled air might well increase the fire hazard in this area. If there are appropriately trained MRI personnel available during the emergency who are able to keep the emergency responders from the magnet room and the five gauss line, then quenching the magnet should not be a requirement. As part of the Zone III and IV restrictions, all MR sites must have clearly marked, readily accessible MR Conditional or MR Safe fire extinguishing equipment physically stored within Zone III or IV.
C.) If the fire or emergency is in the magnet room, and the emergency response personnel and their equipment must enter the room, a decision to quench the magnet should be made to protect the health and lives of the emergency responders. Should a quench be performed, appropriately designated MRI personnel still need to ensure that

all non MRI personnel continue to be restricted from the magnet room until the designated MRI personnel have verified that the static field is either no longer detectable or at least sufficiently attenuated so as to no longer present a potential hazard (see Cryogen related policy)

# In the event of a fire at any YNHH MRI suites and please follow the following 

## procedure:

## R.A.C.E. RESPONSE PROTOCOL:

R.A.C.E. Stands for RESCUE, ALARM, CONFINE AND EXTINGUISH.

- RESCUE: Injured visitors, employees or staff must rapidly be rescued from the immediate area of the fire/smoke origin.
- ALARM: At the sight of flames or smoke, immediately activate a Fire Alarm Pull Station.
- CONFINE: Fire, Smoke and Toxic combustion products must be confined to the area of fire origin as much as possible. Close the door to the room of fire origin as soon as any rescue is accomplished.
- EXTINGUISH: If at all possible, staff should make one attempt to extinguish the fire with a hand-held fire extinguisher. They are to be used only after Rescue, Alarm and Confine have been completed. A fire extinguisher is not a replacement for activating the fire alarm system. Any fire that a fire extinguisher has been used on is to be reported to the Governing Police Department and/or Fire Marshal.


## To Use a fire Extinguisher, use the PASS Protocol

## P.A.S.S. FIRE EXTINGUISHER PROTOCOL:

P.A.S.S.: method is used for the proper operation of a hand held fire extinguisher.

- P.A.S.S.: Stands for Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep.
- PULL: Pull the safety ring/pin at the top of the fire extinguisher.
- AIM: Aim the discharge nozzle at the base of the fire.
- SQUEEZE: Squeeze the handle of the fire extinguisher together to discharge the agent.
- SWEEP: Sweep the agent side to side at the base of the fire.
- Whenever using a fire extinguisher, the following is to be remembered.
- Maintain a clear exit
- Keep your back to that clear exit.
- If at any time you feel as if you are in danger evacuate the area and close the door behind you.
![img-4.jpeg](images/img-4.jpeg.png)


# YNHH MRI CENTERS GENERAL EVACUATION PLAN 

## IN CASE FIRE OR SMOKE

1. Stay calm.
2. Always sound the building fire alarm immediately. If the alarm fails to operate, warn other occupants by knocking on doors and shouting warnings.
3. Call your centers Emergency number. (Temple ST 911, YNHH 155, St. Raphael's 155, Guilford 911, North Haven 911, Yale University Office of the Fire Marshal @ (203) 4329923) from a safely located telephone. Give as much information as possible to the dispatcher. Do not assume that someone else has already notified them. They will immediately notify the Fire Department and

dispatch officers to the scene. Do not hang up until told to do so by the dispatcher.
4. Before opening the door, feel it with the back of your hand. If it is not hot skip to STEP 5. If it is hot, do the following

- Seal cracks around the door with towels, tape, bed clothing or similar items to keep out the smoke. Shout for help. Call your centers Emergency number. (Temple ST 911, YNHH 155, St. Raphael's 155, Guilford 911, North Haven 911 Yale University Office of the Fire Marshal 203-432-9923) and tell them that you are unable to get out of your room. They will be in contact with officers at the fire. Remain calm until firefighters reach you from the hallway or window. Their first duty upon arriving at a fire is to search for persons trapped in the burning building.

5. If you are able to leave your room, do so immediately and:

- Take your key with you in case you are forced to return. Close all doors behind you as you exit. This will lessen the spread of smoke and damage.
- Go to the nearest exit or stairway. Do not use an elevator.
- If smoke, heat or fire blocks your exit, go to an alternate exit.
- If all exits from a floor are blocked go back to your room and follow the procedures described above in step 4

6. If smoke is present, keep low to the floor. Take short breaths to avoid inhaling any more smoke than necessary.
7. Leave the building immediately. When the Police and/or Firefighters arrive, direct them to the fire.

Non-essential staff should follow exit signs and or the directions of Police and Firefighters. Do not re-enter the building for any reason until the Fire Department has declared it safe.

# FIRE ALARM ACTIVATION PROCEDURE 

In the event of a fire alarm activation alarm or other emergency, visitors, employees and non-essential staff are to evacuate the building using the nearest stairway or exit. Essential staff and patients undergoing procedures should be aware of their surroundings and be vigilant in checking for smoke or fire. An immediate evacuation order may be issued by Governing Fire, Security, Police Department, or a representative from the Fire Marshal's Office. If an evacuation order is issued, it must be followed immediately.

Elevators are not to be used during a fire alarm or smoke/fire condition. During a fire alarm evacuation, non-essential staff should assist ambulatory patients in evacuating the building by following the exit signs which lead to the building exits. Once outside, everyone should move away from the exit discharge doors of the building and to avoid congregating close to the building where they may hamper emergency operations. Do not block the exits or fire department access to the building.

The onsite administrator or business manager of each department will be responsible for the management of the evacuation process. They are to have a list of all employees in their department with them and are to advise the fire department of any employee that is missing. If the onsite administrator or business manager is not available, they are to have designated someone who is to manage the evacuation process for their department or group.

Any disabled individual who cannot evacuate using the outside means of egress are to be moved to the other side of the smoke barrier doors and wait for the fire department to remove them safely from the building. The buddy system is to be used for these employees. YNHH staff is to notify the fire department when they reach the street that there may be disabled individuals still in the building and where they are located. The fire alarm system is not to be silenced or reset without the permission of the fire department.

Occupants are not to reenter the building until the "All Clear" is given by the fire department.

# MRI EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 

- When a call has been placed for a fire or police emergency in the MRI Center, MR technologists at all scanners should immediately stop scanning and remove patients from the scanner room.
- The MR safety officer should be called and informed of the emergent situation so that they can be on site prior to the arrival of emergency personnel.
- The MR safety officer and a designated MR staff member should monitor the scanner room doors to prevent free access by emergency personnel. (NOTE: Even in the event of a fire or other emergency the magnetic fields are likely to be present and fully operational.)
- In the case of a fire that is not in the scanner room, quenching the magnet should not become necessary.
- If the fire is in a location that fire fighters and their equipment (oxygen, canisters, crowbars, axes, defibrillators, ETC.) need to enter the scanner room, a decision to quench the magnet may become necessary to protect the health and lives of the emergency personnel.
- If a quench is performed the MR safety officer and MR technologists need to ensure that all emergency personnel are restricted from the scanner room until the static magnetic field is no longer present.


## FIRE PREVENTION PLAN:

Accumulations of flammable or combustible waste material are not to be left in the building. Computer rooms are not to be used for storage. All combustible waste materials are to be removed each day. Smoking is not allowed anywhere in the building. Corridors and stairs are not to be used for storage or equipment areas since they become an obstruction during an emergency. Storage and equipment can cause a fire if it is energized equipment, or contribute fuel to a fire, which will fill the corridor with smoke and toxic fumes. The building has a fire alarm system with consists of smoke detectors and pull stations and a fire sprinkler system. The building has also been provided with emergency lighting and exit signs to locate the exit stairwells. Hand held fire extinguishers have been provided throughout the building.
Questions regarding Yale University building be directed to the Yale University Office of the Fire Marshal @ (203) 4329923

In the event of a system quench it is imperative that all personnel/patients be evacuated from the MR scan room as quickly and as safely feasible.

- Stop all scanning and open the scan room door immediately. If the door to the scan room is closed the pressure may build up making it impossible to open the door. In this event, it may become necessary to break the glass window to allow the gasses to escape and the pressure to lessen so that the scan room door may be opened.
- The access to the scan room should be immediately restricted to all individuals until the arrival of the MR equipment service personnel.
- Do not rely upon the oxygen sensors in the room to warn of low oxygen levels in the room. This technology is now considered by industry experts not to be sufficiently reliable to allow for continued operations during situations of power outage, etc.
- It is especially important to ensure that all police and fire response personnel are restricted from entering the MR scan room with their equipment (axes, air tanks, guns, etc.) until it can be confirmed that the magnetic field has been successfully dissipated, as there may still be considerable static magnetic field present despite a quench or partial quench of the magnet.
- MR Safety Officer and MR Medical Director need to be informed immediately

| MRI Safety Manual | SUBJECT: MRI SAFETY SCREENING: PERSONNEL, |  |  |

# MRI Personnel Screening: 

All MR personnel are to undergo an MR Screening process as part of their employment interview to ensure their own safety in the MR environment. At this time, it is the employees' responsibility to fully disclose any trauma, procedure or surgery that they have experienced or undergone in which ferromagnetic objects or devices may have become introduced within them or on them. This will permit an appropriate screening to be performed upon the employee to determine the safety of introducing them to the MR environment.

## Personnel Definitions:

## Non-MR Personnel

Patients, visitors or facility staff who do not meet the criteria of level 1 or level 2 MR personnel will be referred to as non-MR personnel. Specifically, non-MR personnel will be the terminology used to refer to any individual or group who has not within the previous 12 months undergone the designated formal training in MR safety issues defined by the MR safety director of that installation.

# Level 1 MR Personnel 

Individuals who have passed minimal safety educational efforts to ensure their own safety as they work within Zone III and IV will be referred to as level 1 MR personnel (e.g., MRI department office staff and patient aides.) Level 1 MR personnel are not permitted to directly admit, or be designated responsible for, non-MR personnel in Zone IV.

## Level 2 MR Personnel

Individuals who have been more extensively trained and educated in the broader aspects of MR safety issues, including, issues related to the potential for thermal loading or burns and direct neuromuscular excitation from rapidly changing gradients, will be referred to as level 2 MR personnel (e.g., MRI technologists, radiologists, radiology department nursing staff.)

## MRI Personnel and Non MRI Personnel:

All individuals working in Zones III and/or IV of the MR environment should be documented to have completed the MR safety program consisting of at least one MR safety lecture a year approved by the medical director. These educational efforts should be documented and reviewed annually.

## Personnel MR Training:

All employees must be safety trained before entering the suite. Specific training will be up to the medical director and continually accessed to meet department needs. At many YNHH facilities training includes filling out an employee MRI screening

sheet, watching a designated MR safety video and speaking with a level 2 MR employee.

# Family Members and Non MR Personnel: 

All family members and companions entering Zones III and/or Zone IV will be required to complete an MRI safety form. Any positive responses and possible contraindications to these areas will be discussed with the MR technologist. If the technologist cannot resolve the issues the radiologist will be consulted.

In addition to the screening form, pregnant family members who want to go into zone IV will also be given information about pregnancy and MRI. It is their choice to stay in the room during the MRI.

All non-MR Personnel and family members who are going into Zone IV - the scanner room - will remove all metal objects and personal belongings, and will be wanded by a ferrous metal detector in Zone II before given permission to enter Zone III and Zone IV..

## Device/Object Screening:

- MRI staff members should pay particular attention to the stretchers and beds of inpatient and remove all oxygen tanks and any other potential hazards.
- All portable metallic or partially metallic devices that are on or external to the patient (e.g., oxygen cylinders) are to be positively identified in writing as nonferromagnetic and either MR safe or MR compatible prior to admitting them into Zone III.

- As part of the Zone III site restriction and equipment testing and clearing responsibilities, all sites should have ready access to a strong handheld magnet (1000-Gauss) and/or a handheld ferromagnetic detection device. This will enable the site to test external, and even some superficial internal devices or implants for the presence of grossly detectable ferromagnetic attractive forces.
- If external devices/objects are demonstrated to be ferromagnetic and non-MR safe/conditional, they may still, under specific circumstances, be brought into Zone IV if deemed by MR personnel to be necessary and appropriate for the care of the patient (ex. arterial line, catheter bag with clip). These devices/objects must be appropriately secured at all times. The safe utilization of these devices is the responsibility of MR personnel to ensure that they do not inadvertently become introduced too close to the MRI scanner and become a hazardous projectile or no longer accurately function.
- Never assume MR safety information about any device if it's not clearly documented in writing and following ASTM testing standards. If a device's MR safety status is unknown, it should not be permitted in the magnet field.
- A prior MR examination with an implanted device at any given static magnetic field strength (stronger or weaker) is not in and of itself sufficient evidence, and will not be relied upon to determine the MR safety

- Outpatients will be checked in by the receptionist at the front desk of the MRI department. Two Patient identification markers will be used. (Example Full Name, DOB, Address). They will be given a wrist band and be handed a safety sheet to fill out (if not done beforehand). Anyone accompanying the patient will also fill out a safety sheet.
- The MR personnel (level 1 or 2 ) will review the safety sheet to ensure that there are no positive responses. Any positive responses will be discussed between the patient and a level 2 staff member to confirm that the patient has understood the safety form and understands any risks that are involved with the MRI procedure.
- If the patient is getting contrast two additional steps should be taken before scheduling the patient. The patients eGFR and pregnancy status (if applicable) should be known.
- The patient will be instructed to remove any metal objects and secure their belongings in the lockers. All patients will be requested to change into hospital attire.
- After the patient has changed, the patient and any accompanying companions or facility staff members will be wanded with a ferromagnetic detector have a final

check, or full stop for patient and exam verification, metallic objects and any contraindications to the MRI procedure with Level 2 MR staff.

- Having safely undergone a prior MR examination with an implanted device at any given static magnetic field strength (stronger or weaker) is not in and of itself sufficient evidence, and will not be relied upon to determine the MR safety/compatibility for that device

# MRI Screening Process for all Inpatients 

- Inpatient safety needs to be reviewed every time a patient has an MRI. They will be screened utilizing the inpatient screening form located in Epic. The form will be filled out on the floor with the patient. The patient needs to be alert and oriented x 3 to be able to fill out their own screening sheet. If the patient is unable to complete the form (i.e. due to altered mental status) a nurse, physician, and/or family member may complete the form on the patient's behalf. (Unresponsive patients with no family members please see page 37 )
- If the patient is getting contrast two additional steps should be taken before scheduling the patient. The patients eGFR and pregnancy status (if applicable) should be known
- Inpatients will have their safety form reviewed for any contraindications to the MR procedure by the MR personnel before an appointment will be scheduled. Inpatients will not be scheduled without a complete and signed safety form.
- After these steps the patient will be scheduled.

- The patient will be put into the transport system. The inpatient transporter will transport the patient to the designated Zone II area, where staff will inform the technologists of the patient arrival
- Inpatients including emergency room patients should be prepared for their MRI exam before they leave their floor: all personal belongings (including clothing) should remain at bedside and not travel with patients to the MR procedure area.
- In Zone 2 in the MRI facility, MR unsafe medical equipment will be replaced with MR Conditional equipment.
- If the patient is on oxygen they will be put on walled oxygen.
- Before entering Zone III the patient will be wanded with a ferromagnetic detector and have a final check, or full stop for patient identification, exam verification and all safety concerns with level 2 MR staff
- For mechanically ventilated patient please follow that specific process.
- Any accompanying companions or facility staff members will also be wanded and safety screened by MR staff for any ferromagnetic objects or safety concerns
- Having safely undergone a prior MR examination with an implanted device at any given static magnetic field strength (stronger or weaker) is not in and of itself sufficient evidence, and will not be relied upon to determine the MR safety/compatibility for that device

| MRI Safety Manual | SUBJECT: Unresponsive Patients in MRI |  |  |

# I. Policy 

Screening of patients for whom an MR examination is deemed necessary but who are unconscious, unresponsive, not $A O \times 3$ or for other reasons unable to provide their own reliable histories regarding prior surgery or exposure to metallic foreign objects, and for whom such histories cannot be reliably obtained from others:

The patient should be physically examined for evidence of possible surgery or trauma involving metal, and these areas should be subject to plain-film radiography (if recently obtained imaging of such areas is not already available)

The patient should undergo plain film radiography of the chest and skull or orbits to exclude potentially dangerous metallic foreign objects/devices.

Final determination of whether or not to scan any given patient will be made by the supervising radiologist.

## II. Procedure

If a patient is unconscious, unresponsive or for other reasons unable to provide their own reliable histories, the responsible health care professional or supervising radiologist will order plain-film radiographs of the chest and skull or orbits. A verbal order to MRI technologist is acceptable.

The ordering health care professional will examine the patient for any additional areas of scars or deformities that might be anatomically indicative of an implant, or foreign body. This examination will be documented in Epic (progress notes) before the patient will be scheduled for their MRI exam. If any areas of concern are found, they can be imaged with plain film radiography based on the ordering physician and/or the radiologist's request.

A radiologist from the service (i.e. Neuro, MSK, Body, Peds) that will interpret the ordered MRI examination will determine whether there are any contraindications for the MRI. The same service will interpret and dictate the plain-film radiographs obtained for MRI screening.

Prior to the patient being scheduled, the supervising radiologist may review the safety sheet with the MRI technologist and provide verbal approval, but such approval must be documented and scanned into the patient's chart

After the patient has been cleared by the radiologist, the standard inpatient process will continue.

- No oxygen cylinders of any kind will be allowed in Zone IV - the scan room
- When the patient enters Zone IV - the scan room - the patient will be hooked up to wall mounted oxygen
- Under no circumstances will standard ferromagnetic oxygen tanks be brought into Zones III or Zone IV.
- MRI conditional oxygen cylinders are allowed in Zone III with strict supervision on a case by case basis. NEVER Zone IV
- Hospital staff transporting inpatients with standard ferrous oxygen cylinders will exchange the O 2 from tank to wall O 2 . All ferromagnetic oxygen cylinders will be stored in a holder. While the patient waits for their exam or waits to be transported back to their room the wall mounted oxygen will be used
- MRI conditional oxygen cylinders are silver with a light green top.

The "Oxytote" oxygen cylinders are not MRI safe. They indeed have ferromagnetic components. They are to be treated as any other ferrous oxygen cylinder and will be exchanged for our traditional aluminum cylinders as outlined above.

# Policy 

"All patients who have a history of orbit trauma by a potential ferromagnetic foreign body for which they sought medical attention are to have their orbits cleared by either plain X-ray orbit films ( 2 views) or by a radiologist's review and assessment of contiguous cut prior CT or MR images (obtained since the suspected traumatic event) if available". -ACR white paper 2013

## Procedure

At YNHH a patient will have orbital x-rays for foreign body if the following criteria are met:

- They have sought out medical attention in the past for a foreign body in the orbit.
- No available CT or MRI for a radiologist to verify they are cleared.

If a patient arrives for an MRI and needs orbital x-rays, it is appropriate for the technologist to take a verbal or written order from the radiology attending physician.

There is no need to obtain an order from the patient's referring physician, inpatient or outpatient.

## Radiologist Responsibility

A radiologist from the service (i.e. Neuro, MSK, Body, Peds) that will interpret the ordered MRI examination will determine whether there are any contraindications for the MRI. This service will interpret and dictate the plain-film radiographs obtained for MRI screening.

|  |  | VALUES, STENTS, LEADS, PACEMAKERS |  |

# CARDIAC VALVES 

All cardiac valves are considered immediately safe to scan on a 1.5 T and 3 T .

## CORONARY ARTERY STENTS

All coronary stents are considered immediately safe to scan on a 1.5 T and 3 T

## CARDIAC LEADS

Abandoned epicardial leads are considered safe to scan on 1.5 and 3 T . These are small leads often placed during cardiac surgery that can be pulled or left in place. They are attached to the epicardial surface and are not burrowed into the myocardium or within the heart chambers. They are short in length and usually do not loop and therefore are considered MRI safe. For typical xray appearance see link below
https://radiopaedia.org/images/885691
Abandoned intracardiac pacing or ICD leads should be brought to an attending radiologist's attention for further evaluation. If it is unclear if there are abandoned leads a recent chest x-ray should be reviewed or a new chest x-ray ordered if needed. Any MR scan where the intracardiac leads are in the RF field is not recommended due to potential of significant heating and conduction and should only be done after attending radiologist approval after risk/benefit discussion. Informed patient consent is required.

Scans where the retained leads are not within the RF field for the ordered MRI are at very low risk for heating. These require attending radiologist approval but do not require informed consent from the patient.

Note, abandoned/retained intracardiac leads may be present when the patient still has a working pacemaker/ICD. These abandoned leads can also effect leads of a MRI conditional pacemaker and should be handled in similar fashion.

# Performing Cardiac Pacemaker/Defibrillator StudiesRadiologist Guide 

## Workflow/Process- Multiple departments involved

1. Radiologist Approves the Case based on indication and necessity of obtaining MRI (see steps below)
2. EP approves, (A) device and (B) patient's clinical status being fit more MRI
3. Patient scheduled with 3 resources (1) 1.5 T MRI machine, (2) Radiology Nursing and (3) EP team.

## What is the Radiologists responsibility?

The initial step of imaging any patient with a pacemaker is assessing the appropriateness of the request and need for the MRI. This responsibility lies on a radiologist from the section supervising the case.

## How do you know if there is an MRI request for a patient with a pacemaker?

Study that the Clinician has indicated the patient has a pacemaker or defibrillator
![img-8.jpeg](images/img-8.jpeg.png)

## How does the radiologist disapprove or approve and protocol a case?

- Responsible Attending: An attending radiologist must review indication for all pacemaker requests and have their name entered in the Responsible Attending field; except for select neuroradiology studies per protocol below defined with neuroradiology division. For those specific studies, click the checkbox next to Per history (for select neuroradiology indications only). NOTE- a resident/fellow can still protocol all these cases, they just need to list attending who approved the case. If attending protocols, please list your own name in the space.

- If radiologist agrees with the Indication for the MRI order, click Medically Necessary and protocol exam as you normally would. NOTE- our job is to assess if the MRI is needed. The EP team assess the pacemaker system and determines MR Conditional or Non MR Conditional status and if they can be scanned offlabel when needed. For some studies they will re-consult the radiologist to discuss.
- If radiologist disagrees with the order the radiologist should indicate Do Not Proceed and write comments on agreement/discussion that occurred with ordering provider in comments section. Alternatively, the radiologist can indicate Do Not Proceed and write comments on reasoning and a radiology scheduling assistant (CSA) will communicate this to ordering provider on behalf of the radiologist. When requested by the ordering provider, they will notify radiologist to discuss case further with the ordering provider.

# MRI pacemaker - Neuroradiology exempt indications list 

This list is:
-Stroke cases
-Multiple Sclerosis (MS) evaluation
-Malignancy staging/work-up/gamma knife planning
-R/o cord compression
-R/o Osteo/discitis
-Any cases ordered by Orthopedics/Neurology/neurosurgery (since they have usually given thought into whether MRI is truly needed or not). This includes out-patient providers from these specialties.

All other cases handled by the neuroradiology division need to follow standard process detailed above.

# Life/Limb-Threatening (STAT) MRI in Patients with an Implanted Cardiac Device (ICD) policy for ED or In-patients 

Objective: Order to begin time of under two hours during normal weekday business hours or by 10am following business day.

## Work-flow for ordering health care professional

Health care provider orders highest priority MRI (Life/Limb Threatening -Within 2 hours) and notes presence of pacer/ICD.

MRI scans of patients with implanted cardiac devices can only be performed M-F (excluding holidays) between 8am-5pm

- Call the Smilow MRI tech at (203-200-5144) to inform them of this order.
- EP team will need chest-x-ray within 48 hours prior to MRI. If none is available, order stat portable chest x-ray with indication "evaluate implanted cardiac device prior to MRI".
- Do not request EP consult. Radiology department will contact relevant EP team for this study.
- Nurse or provider must fill out MRI safety sheet ASAP.


## Work-flow following placement of order of Life/limb threatening (true Stat) MRI

- When exam is ordered, scheduler contacts radiologist.
- Radiologist approves MRI following routine pacemaker approval process. Radiologist will discuss with clinical team and technologist as needed
- Radiologist protocols exam.
- If technologist or scheduler observes that a life-threatening/STAT MRI order for a pacemaker patient exists with no protocol, they will immediately call responsible radiology service during normal business hours or first thing in AM if ordered after hours to get approval and protocol
- Once exam is approved and protocoled by radiologist, scheduler immediately contacts EP team (203-506-3493) and notifies them of Life-Threatening MRI exam to initiate emergent EP approval process
- EP team informs MRI scheduler when they will be available to assess patient and approve/reject MRI exam.
- When expected time for EP clearance is known, scheduler communicates this information to ordering health care professional.
- Scheduler also informs health care team that patient's nurse (not MRI or transport team) will be responsible for patient transport to MRI when called.
- Provider may be required to stay for MRI for select exams (eg. hyperacute stroke)

For brain aneurysm clips and cardiac devices (e.g. pacemakers and defibrillators) please refer to separate policy in MRI Safety Manual.

Many older or discontinued devices have not undergone testing at 3T. Although it is preferred that patients with such an untested device undergo MRI at 1.5 T , if a scan at 1.5 T is not feasible or a 3 T exam is preferred for legitimate clinical reasons, the patient may undergo MRI at 3 T .

Minimum SAR for diagnostic clinical images will be used. The technologist has flexibility to edit scanner parameters. If needed, image quality can be reviewed with radiologist to ensure diagnostic quality.

- Other aneurysm clips may be acceptable on a 3T as long as guidelines are met. To image an aneurysm clip on 3T, specific information (i.e., manufacturer, type or model, and material) about the aneurysm clip must be known and documented. The technologist will check the implant against Dr. Shellocks, "The List" located at www.mrisafety.com for confirmation, or the company's site if ASTM guidelines for testing have been followed.
- If the type of aneurysm clip cannot be identified and documented the MRI will not be done unless approved by a radiologist.
- If the artifact is great, moving the patient to a 1.5 might be considered if possible

# Orthodontic Appliances Policy 

Most dental braces/orthodontic hardware is non-ferromagnetic, but some exhibit measurable deflection in a strong magnetic field, and others include magnetic components.

Patients may experience vibrations. Loosening is possible if the dental implant is not firmly bonded or ligated.

Artifacts from metal components may interfere with assessment of certain parts of the brain or cervical spine, especially at 3 T .

## MRI PROCESS

## Prior to appointment

During the pre-appointment call, the MRI tech aid ${ }^{1}$ will alert patients with orthodontic appliances that they may feel slight vibrations during MRI. The patient will be advised that they are not required to remove fixed appliances (including wires) prior to any spine/chest/abdominal/pelvic/extremity MRI. However, any components that are easily detachable should be removed before the exam, and loose components should be tightened or secured prior to the exam.

Patients undergoing MRI of the brain should be informed that their MRI images will be monitored for significant MRI artifact, which may necessitate a repeat exam following removal of orthodontic appliance. Outpatients who require general anesthesia (intubation) to undergo MRI are required to have orthodontic appliances removed prior to exam. Patients who are intubated for other reasons (e.g. from the ED) do not require hardware removal.
Patients undergoing MRI with conscious/moderate sedation do not require orthodontic hardware removal.

## Immediately prior to exam

Confirm with patient that their orthodontic appliance is not loose, does not employ

magnets, and is not otherwise MRI conditional or unsafe.

# During MRI 

If there is interfering artifact, the images should be reviewed by the supervising radiologist to ensure the scan is diagnostic. If necessary, sequences may be repeated after swap of phase and frequency encoding directions to move artifact away from area of interest and/or moving patient to a 1.5 Tesla scanner, if available.

If the radiologist determines that the artifact is serious enough to request removing the wires from the braces, the patient will reschedule after removal.

In truly emergent (hospitalized or ED patients) cases where the scan must be repeated for patient care, the referring service (not MRI or radiologist) should contact pediatric or adult dentistry services via page operator to assist with hardware removal prior to attempting re-scan.
${ }^{1}$ Recommended script for tech aid for a patient that has orthodontic hardware/braces that is undergoing a brain MRI:
"Almost all dental appliances such as braces decrease the MRI scan quality, but the test is usually still diagnostic. We do not recommend that you have them removed unless you need general anesthesia to complete the MRI, but if they make it difficult for the radiologist to evaluate certain parts of the brain, we may ask that you return for a repeat MRI after having them removed. Any parts that are easily detachable should be removed before the exam, and any that are loose should be tightened or secured prior to the exam."

Recommended script for tech aid for a patient that has orthodontic appliance that is undergoing MRI of any body part besides MRI brain:
"Your braces/dental hardware, including wires, should not affect the quality of your MRI and do not need to be removed, but you may feel some vibration or mild tugging during the test. Any parts that are easily detachable should be removed before the exam, and any that are loose should be tightened or secured prior to the exam."

# Wound Dressings and Trans-Dermal Medication Patches 

There are thousands of medical dressings and trans-dermal medication patches that are available and have never been tested for MRI safety. Some wound dressings may contain silver, and some Trans dermal medication patches have a metallic backing. Even clear medication patches could contain metallic particles that are invisible to the naked eye.
Exposing these dressings or patches to excessive (RF) can increase their temperature. Increased temperature of metallic particles could cause burns to the patient. Also an increase temperature of a trans dermal patch could in theory alter the dosage given by the transdermal patch.

## Transdermal Medication Patches

Transdermal Medication patches like (fentanyl patches) contain prescribed medication. It is out of a technologist's scope of practice to manage these medication patches. ANY patch located in the Radio Frequency (RF) field needs to be removed as we can not reliably determine if a patch has a metal backing. If a patch is known to have metal backing, it needs to be removed before the MRI even if not location in the RF field.

## Outpatients:

Outpatients will remove their own transdermal drug delivery patches that need to be removed per guidelines above. After the exam the patient will be given the original patch back and should contact their prescribing physician for a replacement if needed.

## Inpatients

Any medication patches that need to be removed should be removed by the floor RN before the patient is sent for. DI nursing will remove any inpatient medication patches per standard hospital protocol.

## Wound Dressings that do not contain metallic components or medication

Wounds dressings that don't contain silver or any medication have no MRI restrictions.

## Wounds Dressings that possibly contain metallic components or medication

Wound dressings that contain or possibly contain silver /medication are evaluated on an individual basis before having an MRI by the MRI team and the Radiologist

## Some of the questions to consider are:

Is the dressing in the RF field? Can the exam be shortened? Is it urgent?
Will the chemical makeup of the dressing degrade image quality?

## MRI Information for Gyrus ACMI Otology Implant Devices

MR imaging is considered contraindicated for patients with metallic implant because of risks associated with movement or dislodgment for ferromagnetic implants and MRI-related heating for metallic implants that are a certain length or that form a closed conducting loop. With the exception of several production lots of a particular type of middle ear implant (see Table One) manufactured and distributed in late 1987 and early 1988, materials used by Gyrus ACMI in the manufacture of middle ear implant devices are generally considered acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures (see below).

## Table One

Specific Lots of S\&N, Inc. (Richards) McGee Platinum/Stainless Steel Pistons Contraindicated for MRI
This series of McGee Platinum/Stainless Steel pistons were manufactured with a ferromagnetic stainless steel in late 1987 and early 1988. The affected production lots of these pistons, given in Table 1 below, were recalled by Smith \& Nephew, Inc. in 1989. Importantly, MRI is contraindicated for anyone having received a McGee Platinum/Stainless Steel piston from these lots.

## MRI Information

All current Gyrus ACMI MR Conditional implants are packaged with an MRI Patient Card.
(*Please review the explanation of the previous and current labeling terms applied to implants and devices, to follow.):

## MR-Safe*

Devices that are made from non-metallic materials (i.e. Implants and Ventilation Tubes made from HA, Plasti-pore, Silicone, Fluoroplastic) are inherently non-conducting and non-magnetic and pose no known hazards in all MR environments and therefore are considered MR Safe.

## MR-Conditional*

Devices that have been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a specified MRI environment with specified conditions of use. Field conditions that define the MRI environment include static magnetic field strength, spatial gradient, dB/dt (time varying magnetic fields), radio frequency (RF) fields, and specific absorption rate (SAR). Additional conditions, including specific configurations of the item (e.g., the routing of leads used for a neurostimulation system), may be required.

# OLYMPUS 

## Your Vision, Our Future

The MRI Conditional Information for Gyrus ACMI implants (excluding the Lots listed in Table One above) is, as follows:
Non-clinical testing of representative worst case samples has demonstrated that patients with these specific Gyrus ACMI otologic implants can undergo MRI safely, immediately after implantation under the following conditions:

- Static magnetic field of 3-Tesla or less
- Maximum spatial gradient field of $720-\mathrm{Gauss} / \mathrm{cm}$ or less.
- MR system reported, whole-body-averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of $2-\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{kg}$ for 15 minutes of scanning (i.e., per pulse sequence).

The following tables summarize the Gyrus ACMI implants, based on worst case representative sample testing (data on file), available literature reviewed as referenced below ${ }^{1-7}$, and a review of the materials used in their construction as allowed by ASTM F2503 ${ }^{8}$

An attending radiologist (or trainee in consultation with attending radiologists) should weigh the risks versus benefits of the MRI. If a resident or fellow protocols the case, they need to include the name of the attending radiologist who made the decision in the protocol.

If the patient states they have been shot and states that no bullets/fragments remain, no further investigation of the area is recommended. If the patient is unsure if bullets/fragments are remaining, the issue should be brought to the radiologist's attention. In those cases, further imaging with x-rays or review of any prior imaging of the area of interest will likely be needed to get a better sense of bullet location and bullet shape.

Traditionally, risks from retained metallic foreign objects (bullets and shrapnel) in the body have been (1) heating from RF exposure, and (2) movement (translation and rotation), which may injure adjacent structures. Studies have shown that temperature changes occurring with small metal object, such as bullets, is minimal ${ }^{1}$. Thus, in practice, the major safety issue is movement. This risk only pertains to bullets/fragments that contain ferromagnetic componets ${ }^{1}$. In each case, the supervising radiologist must weigh the potential benefits of the MRI exam versus the potential risks. Below are some considerations to help guide the decision:
Size: The less mass the object has the less likely it is to shift position.
Shape: Objects with jagged edges or sharp points have higher risk to injure an adjacent structure Composition: Bullets with steel or stainless steel cores (such as armor piercing bullets and some shotgun bullets) have the highest risk of movement. Non-steel containing bullets are unlikely to be ferromagnetic and will not move in the MRI magnetic field ${ }^{1,2}$. If the bullet has broken up within the body and created a trail, the composition is likely nonferrous ${ }^{2}$. If the composition of the bullet is not known, you should presume it may be ferromagnetic.

[^0]
[^0]:    If the shooting was military related, it could be an armor piercing bullet which may be ferrous but may also fragment. In that setting, presume it is ferrous and higher risk.

    If patient has been shot multiple times in same region it will be difficult to know if all bullets/fragments are nonferrous. In this setting assume it is ferrous/higher risk.

Location: If it is not located adjacent to a vital neural, vascular, or soft tissue anatomic structure, movement of the object is unlikely to result in harm, regardless of the composition. For example, a small metallic foreign body in the subcutaneous tissues or bone poses minimal risk to the patient. A bullet embedded fully within the bone and away from neurovascular structures/spinal canal it should have very little risk.

Length of time the object has been lodged: The longer an object is inside the body, the more likely it has been secured by scar tissues, and less likely it is to shift positions.

# What should we do if radiologist deems there is potential risk of injury (eg. near vessel or nerve), but MRI is needed for patient care? 

In this situation, the risk versus benefit should be discussed with the ordering health care professional. If he/she deems the MRI necessary and the radiologist agrees, this should be documented in Epic and written informed consent should be obtained from the patient. The MR should be performed at 1.5 T . Patient should be slowly placed into and removed from scanner.

## Here is an example of risk versus benefit workflow:

A patient has multiple fragments under the skin in his hand for 10+ years and a MRI of the brain was ordered for stroke

- Size- Minimal risk
- Shape- Minimal risk
- Composition- Unlikely you will know what composition is. Modern BBs are usually made from steel and plated with zinc or copper. They have the potential for movement in the magnetic field. Other BBs (especially older ones) are made of lead and will remain in place.
- Location- Minimal risk for any harm if bullet has some movement
- Length of time: +10 years

Decision= Scan, minimal risk. No informed consent needed.

Technologist to ask is the injury military related (armor piercing bullet) ${ }^{1}$

# https://www.aironline.org/doi/full/10.2214/AJR.20.23648 

## Lower Risk

If the bullet is fragmented, it is likely composed of nonferrous metal.

If the bullet/fragment has smooth or rounded edges, movement unlikely to damage surrounding tissue.

If the shooting occurred $>1 \mathrm{~m}$ ago, it has higher chance of being stabilized by scar tissue.

## Higher Risk

If the bullet is intact, it is more likely composed of ferrous metal.

If the bullet has jagged/sharp edges, movement is more likely to damage surrounding.

If the shooting is recent, it is less likely to be secured by scar tissue.

If Radiologist determines low risk of injury, decision should be documented in Epic by that radiologist or his designee (which may be MRI tech).

If Radiologist determines higher risk of injury but MRI clinically necessary without alternate test than discuss with ordering physician, obtain written informed consent, and image on a 1.5 T scanner.

| MANUAL | SUBJECT: External Fixators |  |  |
| MRI Safety Manual |  |  |  |

De Puy Synthes has updated their labeling on all standard external fixators to the ASTM 2005 guidelines of MR Safe, MR Conditional and MR Unsafe. This labeling is retroactive so all fixators currently on the market that were labeled MR Safe should now be considered MR Conditional. Stryker/Hoffman also has some external fixator devices with MR conditional labeling at 1.5 T (with some approval at 3 T ) as well. Per discussion with vendor the Hoffman 2 MR conditional set has MR conditional FDA approval for scanning the ex-fix within or outside of bore, while the Hoffman 3 MR conditional set only has MR conditional approval for scanning outside of the bore.

Many other manufacturers don't provide any formal guidance on MR safety of their fixators, so safety of these devices is often unclear.

To date there has been no reported incident involving MRI and external fixators (even when scanned off-label) when basic safety principles are followed. The main risks are movement of ferromagnetic parts or RF (or gradient) induced heating or currents. Because there is substantial variability in ex-fix parts and construct it is impossible to test every configuration across multiple MRI sequences.

Guidance is provided below.

# If device is labeled as MR conditional 

Scan at 1.5 T when possible. Some manufacturers only apply MR Conditional status when the fixator is outside of the MRI bore (see discussion above). The MR tech should investigate which device was used and if the MRI for the patient will meet scanning parameters applied to MR conditional status. If device is MR conditional and falls within approved scanning parameters then no further approval process is needed.

If the device needs to enter the bore (but has MR conditional status only applied when it remains outside the bore) then following steps should be taken.

- All external parts of the external fixator are tested with a bar magnet to ensure no ferromagnetic components.
- Keep SAR as low as possible in Normal Operating Mode.
- Protocol should be tailored to the minimum amount of sequences required.

- Radiologist should document in protocol or chart that review was performed (with caring orthopedic team when needed) and that exam is needed for patient care. This is to confirm benefit outweighs theoretical risk of heating/nerve stimulation and possible device movement since device being scanned "off-label".


# If device has no MR safe or MR conditional labeling 

Clinical benefit must outweigh theoretical risks. Always scan at 1.5 T .
The technologist can image the patient with the fixator (within or outside the bore) if the following conditions are met.

- All external parts of the external fixator are tested with a bar magnet to ensure no ferromagnetic components.
- Keep SAR as low as possible in Normal Operating Mode.
- Protocol should be tailored to the minimum amount of sequences required.
- Radiologist should document in protocol or chart that review was performed (with caring orthopedic team when needed) and that exam is needed for patient care. This is to confirm benefit outweighs risks of heating/nerve stimulation and possible device movement since device being scanned "off-label" and no MR safety status exists.

# a.) Pregnant Health Care Employees: 

All pregnant health care practitioners are permitted to work in and around the MR environment throughout all stages of their pregnancy. Although permitted to work in and around the MR environment, pregnant healthcare practitioners are requested not to remain within the MR scanner room during actual data acquisition.

## b.) Pregnant Patients 1.5 and 3T

Pregnant patients may undergo MR scans at any stage of their pregnancy if the referring physician and the supervising radiologist determine that the risk-benefit ratio to the patient warrants that the study be performed.
1.) Pregnant patients may be allowed to have an MRI exam on a 3 Tesla magnet, if the area being imaged is a brain or extremity. Pelvis, abdomen or spine exams should be performed at 1.5 when imaging at 3 T is unlikely to provide additional diagnostic value.
2.) The technologist is required to give the patient an information sheet about MRI and pregnancy. This should be documented.
3.) Fetal MRI can be performed on a 1.5 or 3 T .

4.) Intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents should generally NOT be administered for MRI to pregnant patients. Exceptions may be made at the radiologist discretion, but the reason for the exception must be documented by the radiologist in the EMR.

# c.) Possible Pregnant Patients and NON Contrast 

Patients will not be given a urine hCG test unless they are going to receive a gadolinium-based contrast agent for the MRI exam. In the event the patient is scheduled for a non-contrast exam and is unsure of pregnancy, the department will assume the patient is pregnant and follow the guidelines above for pregnant patients.

## d.) Pregnant Companions

The companion will be given an information sheet on MRI and pregnancy. It is their choice to stay in the room during imaging. (Repeated occupational exposure to TVMF is not an issue).

## e.) Pre procedure Pregnancy Testing

For Pre procedure Pregnancy Testing please follow the:
PATIENT RADIATION PROTECTION \& SAFETY (INCLUDING PREGNANCY) policy located in GENERAL DEPARTMENT GUIDELINES on SharePoint under Radiology.

|  | BREAST FEEDING PATIENTS |  |  |

Review of the literature shows no evidence to suggest that oral ingestion by an infant of the tiny amount of gadolinium contrast medium excreted into breast milk would cause toxic effects [8]. We believe, therefore, that the available data suggest that it is safe for the mother and infant to continue breast-feeding after receiving such an agent.

If the mother remains concerned about any potential ill effects, she should be given the opportunity to make an informed decision as to whether to continue or temporarily abstain from breast-feeding after receiving a gadolinium contrast medium. If the mother so desires, she may abstain from breast-feeding for 24 hours with active expression and discarding of breast milk from both breasts during that period. In anticipation of this, she may wish to use a breast pump to obtain milk before the contrast study to feed the infant during the 24 -hour period following the examination.

# IV Contrast Agents 

No patient is to be administered MR contrast agents without orders from a licensed physician. Intravenous injection-qualified MR technologists may start and attend to peripheral intravenous lines if they have undergone the requisite training.

Injections may be performed through an appropriately sized IV line, which may be removed after the exam. The IV line will remain in place during the examination should IV drug therapy be required. This will apply to all patients.

For a patient with a history of contrast reactions please follow the premedication policy. if a patient experiences a contrast reaction the technologist should immediately contact the radiologist and nurse so that appropriate action may be taken. An incident report (R/L solution) is to be filled out via the intranet under Event Reporting. The FDA and the manufacturer of the contrast should also be contacted.

## Oral Contrast

Please note for exams the patient may be asked to drink Breeza oral contrast. There are no significant contraindications for this agent and the agent can be given safely in patients with reported Sulfa Allergies.

| POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL |  |  |  |
| MRI Safety Manual | SUBJECT: Gadolinium and eGFR Screening |  |  |

The ACR has categorized GBCA agents into groups of risk factors related to Nephrogenic System Fibrosis (NSF). Dotarem, Gadavist, Prohance and Multihance are Group II agents and Eovist is a Group III agent. Group I (highest risk) agents are not currently available/on formulary at YNHH. YNHH patient contrast screening policies has been tailored to the agents and the potential risk of adverse effect related to low eGFR values and risk of NSF when given standard weight based dosing. For a complete list of contrast agent groups and any additional info please visit the ACR website and read the current ACR Manual on Contrast Media https://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Resources/Contrast-Manual.

# OUTPATIENTS 

Contrast from Group II (such as Dotarem)
Outpatients receiving a GBCA from group II do not need to be screened for eGFR.

Contrast from Group III (Eovist)
Outpatients receiving a GBCA agent from groups III who answer YES to one or more of the contrast related questions on the MR Safety Screening Form (diabetic, hypertensive, and renal disease) will be screened for renal function. If an eGFR (or Cr value to calculate eGFR) is on file $<6$ week old this can be used otherwise a value will be obtained day of exam with Point of Care meter.

EGFR only required for Eovist or higher than weight based dosing. If valid eGFR is < 30 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ GBCA from group III will be administered only if all of the following conditions are met;
-Documented approval by the supervising radiologist by assigning/signing an appropriate protocol
-Informed consent obtained by supervising radiologist (or his/her designated resident/fellow) and signed by the patient. (Note: Informed consent and reason for exam should be documented in the report)

# INPATIENTS 

All inpatient requests for contrast-enhanced MRI exams require the ordering health professional to answer a series of ordering screen questions designed to identify patients who might be at risk for NSF. Risk factors include deteriorating renal function.

Contrast from Group II (such as Dotarem)
Inpatients receiving a GBCA from group II do not need to be screened for eGFR.

Contrast from Group III (Eovist)
A documented eGFR $\geq 30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ obtained within 48 hours prior GBCA administration is required.

EGFR only required for Eovist or higher than weight based dosing. If valid eGFR is < 30 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ Eovist will be administered only if all of the following conditions are met;

-Documented approval by the supervising radiologist by assigning and signing an appropriate protocol
-Informed consent obtained by supervising radiologist (or his/her designated resident/fellow) and signed by the patient. (Note: Informed consent and reason for exam should be documented in the report)

# Patients on Dialysis or with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) 

If the patient is on dialysis or has known AKI, laboratory testing and calculation of eGFR is not useful or necessary (i.e., eGFR is not accurate in this setting).

## Contrast from Group II

- Patients who are on dialysis or with AKI and receiving GBCA from group II do not need informed consent given that current data has not shown any unconfounded cases of NSF with these agents.
- Patients on dialysis should be scheduled for dialysis as close as possible following conclusion of the MRI exam. Hemodialysis is preferred over peritoneal dialysis whenever possible due presumed higher efficiency infiltration of GBCAs.


## Contrast from Group III (Eovist)

-Patients who are on dialysis or with AKI and receiving GBCA from group III (Eovist) than informed consent should be obtained.

## Off Label Usage

Radiologists commonly use contrast media for a clinical purpose not contained in the FDA labeling and thus commonly use contrast media off-label. Physicians have latitude in using

gadolinium chelates off label as guided by clinical indication. This also includes pediatric usage in patients under the age of 2 .

# Non-standard Contrast Dosing (ie- double dosing or multiple doses of contrast in 24 hours) 

1. Higher than standard weight based dosing

This is occasionally needed for some group II agents is with some MR angiography, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI applications. In this setting, the Group II agent should be treated like a group III agent (where there is potential for NSF in at risk populations) as there is limited data on utilization of GBCA's with non-standard dosing in this population. The rules of Group III agents as detailed above would apply in this setting.
2. Receiving more than one GBCA dose in 24 hours.

Occasionally patients need more than one dose of GBCA within a 24-hour period. The NSF risk of more than one (standard) dose of a group II or III agents in patients is likely negligible in patients who have eGFR $\geq 30$. If eGFR is $<30$ (and patient is not on dialysis), then all nonstat or non-urgent studies should be delayed for 24 hours to allow for adequate clearance. If on dialysis, dialysis should be performed as soon as possible after the MRI. Therefore, there is no contraindication to undergoing an urgent or stat contrast enhanced MRI for a patient who has already been administered one dose of GBCA within a 24-hour period. Truly urgent or stat studies should not be delayed 24 -hours when eGFR $<30$ if benefits of exam outweigh NSF risks (radiologist-clinical team joint decision).

# Exceptions regarding Contrast Usage in Patients 

Exceptions to the above policies may be made at the discretion of the supervising radiologist, such as in the rare instance of an acute, life-threatening condition, and after consultation with the referring health care professional if consent cannot be obtained from the patient or surrogate when needed. However, the rationale for the exception must be documented by the supervising radiologist.

## Documentation of Contrast Usage

1. MRI technologists will record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to each patient by annotating the MRI exam and documenting dose in EPIC.
2. The radiologist reporting the exam will include the specific GBCA and dose in their report for every contrast-enhanced MRI procedure

# Gad Quick Reference Sheet 

## Who Needs eGFR testing?

## Outpatients

- A patient receiving Eovist (group III agent) that answers yes to questions 19-23
- Patient getting higher than standard dose (ie. Double dosing) of group II/III agent (Cardiac, Gamma Mets exams this is standard)
eGFR Labs must be less than 6 weeks old and eGFR greater than 30 If eGFR less than 30 Radiologist needs to consent.


## Inpatients:

- A patient receiving Eovist (group III agent) eGFR must be less than 2 days old, and greater than 30
- Patient getting higher than standard dose (ie. Double dosing) of group II/III agent (Cardiac, Gamma Mets exams this is standard)

If eGFR is less than 30 Radiologist needs to consent.

## What do we do with prior Gadolinium "allergic-like" event?

If a patient has had a prior reaction to a gadolinium agent but is approved to have a repeat scan with gadolinium (see pretreatment policy in contrast manual) effort should be made to determine which contrast agent the reaction occurred with. If unknown, Dotarem can be used. If with Dotarem, then Multihance should be used.
https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/patientcare/policies/premed ication/ Premedication Policy

## Who needs a Hcg urine test?

All females getting contrast who have started menses or are between ages 1055

Adults (age 18+) can sign a waiver, peds (age 10-17) cannot sign waiver

|  | REQUESTED EXAMS |  |  |

ED patients requiring an MRI will receive priority over most inpatient orders. If there are no available openings on the schedule, the Radiologist will look at the clinical needs of the inpatients scheduled and decide which patient to reschedule to accommodate the most emergent case.
There are multiple levels of "Stat" Ordered exams: Life-Threatening and Urgent:
A Stat patient that is considered Life Threatening will be scheduled within 30 minutes of receipt of the order and the completed safety form. Scanning should begin within 2 hours.

A Stat patient that is considered Urgent will be scheduled within 30 minutes of receipt of the order and the completed safety form. Scanning should begin within 6 hours.

To schedule an ED MRI two important steps must be done before the patient will be given a scheduled time:

1. The order must be placed in EPIC
2. The inpatient screening process must be followed with completion of the MRI safety form.

The next available time slot will be given to the ED requested patient and a call will be placed to the ED to alert them of the time. Patient transportation appointment will be scheduled in advance of scan time

# Yale Diagnostic Radiology In-house MRI Requests: 

October, 2012

- This document sets out the procedures/expectations for MRI requests
- MRI is available 24/7 although there are limited sub-specialized radiologists and technologists available after hours.
- Whilst radiologists and technologists are available after hours, it is important that the requests they respond to are appropriate and clinically indicated.
- MRI requests have therefore recently been divided into 4 categories as follows:

| Category | Definition | Start time* |
| :-- | :-- | :--: |
| Life threatening | Imminent loss of life, <br> limb or function | $<2 h r s$ |
| Urgent | Delay in diagnosis could <br> lead to inferior outcome | $<6 h r s^{* *}$ |
| Routine |  | $<24 h r s$ |
| Time Dependent | Specific timing necessity <br> e.g. sedation, following a <br> procedure etc. | As stipulated by <br> requestor |

*time from receipt of satisfactorily completed safety sheet.
** urgent requests received after 11:00 pm may be scheduled at 6:30 am.

- Life threatening MRI requests will be started within 2 hours of the safety sheet being received 24/7
- In collaboration with the orthopedic, neurology, general and neurosurgery departments, the following definition of life threatening indications have been agreed:

1) Mass Lesion with acute CNS deterioration

CT (or inadequate outside MRI) evidence of a mass lesion with significant neurologic deterioration over 24 hours where the condition is clinically expected to require either

- Further anatomic information (including additional MR sequences) in order to provide safe treatment
or
- Stereotaxy as a necessary part of providing safe operative care (CT-based stereotaxy being inadequate).

2) Acute Spinal Cord Injury or Deterioration

A rapid acute cord compression protocol (see page 81) has been developed for abbreviated MRI exam in patients with suspected cord compression presenting to the ED. Acute injury or deterioration of spinal cord function including weakness and or sacral dysfunction due to a suspected mass lesion, discitis, osteomyelitis, cauda equina syndrome, or epidural abscess.

- Acute deterioration must have occurred over a short enough time such that rapid treatment is likely to result in restoration of function.
- A likely diagnosis of radiculopathy, sensory loss-only or fixed severe deficits of $>48$ hrs duration is NOT deemed life threatening.

3) Unstable Spine Correction

For planning an unstable spine correction, particularly when an occult soft tissue component may compress neural elements upon deformity correction.

- Neurologic exam may be intact. e.g. bilateral jumped facets to rule out disc herniation.

4) Stroke, if:
1) Diagnosis is uncertain.
2) Time of onset is unclear.
(MR perfusion/diffusion in attempt to define ischemic penumbra prior to intravenous lytics/catheter based intervention)
3) Patient has a contrast allergy and needs angiography.
4) Patient is of pediatric age group.
5) Acute Aortic Dissection, if there is a contraindication to iodinated contrast.
6) Acute Appendicitis in Pregnancy, if the general surgery attending consult deems the patient's condition to be life-threatening.

# Stat MRI procedure for Acute Stroke Evaluation 

Selected acute stroke patients will undergo a stat MRI procedure to further assess cerebral ischemia and possible candidacy for thrombolysis or neuro-intervention. Indications include:

1. Patients with a suspected stroke syndrome (NIHSS $\geq 10$ )
2. Patients who present with an uncertain time of symptom onset
3. Patients with an uncertain diagnosis
4. Pediatric patients
5. Patients being considered for CTA but with a known contrast dye allergy
6. Patients suspected to be pregnant
7. The acute stroke team (resident/NP/attending) will enter the order (MRI - brain w and w/o contrast), It is the responsibility of the referring clinician to complete the on-line MRI safety sheet. Assistance will be provided by radiology to determine the presence of cochlear implants, orbital metal, pacemakers etc. from previous imaging.
8. The acute stroke team (resident/NP/attending) will then contact the neuroradiology fellow oncall at 203-200-3181 to alert him/her of the acute stroke patient and MRI order.
9. The neuroradiology fellow will alert the MRI tech supervisor who will check for the completed safety sheet, schedule the case and notify the neuroradiology fellow to protocol the case.
10. Once the case is protocolled the MRI tech supervisor will call the acute stroke team at 203-688-7111 to accompany the patient to the MRI prep hold area. The acute stroke team will remain with the patient at MRI. The only exceptions to this would be if the patient is not found to have an acute stroke, and there are no hemodynamic or respiratory concerns, in which case the patient could be transported back to the ED/floor by standard transport.

- Hyperacute Stroke Protocol includes: Ax DWI, Ax FLAIR and Ax SWI sequences. Ax EPI perfusion will be added if the patient has separate IV access for gadolinium

|  | OVERNIGHT PROCESS |  |  |

Process for overnight MR Cases:

1. The clinician places the order in EPIC, MR staff, Nurse or Clinician obtains and completes the MRI safety sheet via Encounters in EPIC.
2. The patient must be escorted to the MR Suite by an MD, PA, or RN, for patients that require monitoring.

Calling in the MRI tech for a case at SRC when a technologist in no longer in house.
Technologist on call contact info should NEVER be given to a non-radiologist. Only a radiologist can initiate calling in the on-call MRI technologist.

1. Verify:
(a) This is a truly urgent case that needs to be imaged off hours
(b) Ask the ordering physician/team to fill out the MRI safety sheet
(c) Protocol the case and call the on-call technologist to let them know you approved and protocoled the case.
(d) For life threatening cases (such as acute cord compression or stroke) the technologist will come to the hospital once notified of the case. For non-life threatening cases the on call technologist will wait until the safety sheet is completed and cleared before heading to the hospital.
2. Coverage and contact numbers for SRC is detailed below.

SRC is staffed 24 hours Monday to Thursday. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday there is some in house and on call coverage as listed below-

Sunday 10PM - Friday 11PM (Tech in house)
Saturday and Sunday 7am - 3:30pm (Tech in house)

# Acute Cord Compression MRI Protocol 

The acute cord compression protocol has been designed to allow for rapid imaging of high risk patients presenting with new or worsening symptoms, of under 48 hours duration, suspected to have acute cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. The protocol was developed by Radiology in conjunction with MRI Operations, Spine Surgery and Emergency Medicine, to rapidly diagnose or exclude cord compression. Other neurologic conditions that can potentially mimic cord compression symptoms will not be well assessed by this rapid protocol, and the patient may need to come back for repeat imaging in those cases.

## Acute Cord Compression (ACC) Protocol

Steps for neuroradiology once notified of potential case:

1. Neuro-rads called by ED to protocol and discuss case:

- If case is at York Street, alert Smilow MR tech
- If case is at SRC, and tech in house, alert tech
- If after-hours at SRC (this will usually be the neuro attending overnight M-F, and occasionally fellow on weekend), call tech to come in after you approve case (you do not need to wait for safety sheet completion before calling tech). See SRC after-hour coverage on page 84

2. Techs monitor for safety sheet completion and interface with ED staff to transport patient to magnet once safety sheet cleared and MRI ready to accept patient.
3. The provider and/or RN DO NOT need to stay and monitor the patient unless they feel it is necessary because the patient clinical status mandates it.
4. Tech calls neuro-rad to check case after axial and sag sequences done. Contrast and additional sequences can be obtained as discretion of neuroradiologist.
5. Goal:

- MRI safety sheet complete to MRI start of $<2$ hours
- MRI complete to prelim $<1$ hour

Cleaning of the MRI suite to include the table, pads, coils, and the inside of the magnet bore is performed by the MRI staff to prevent the transmission of infections. Routine cleaning personnel are not allowed to enter the MRI suite because of the dangerous magnetic field strength that can cause potential catastrophic events harming personnel and the MRI system.

1. Gloves must always be worn when handling contaminated equipment and working with a cleaning disinfectant.
2. Cleaning of the table and pads is performed before and after each patient exam with a hospital approved disinfectant and all cleaning equipment must be MRI safe.
3. Periodic inspection of pads for fraying and tearing is done each month and replaced as necessary.
4. Patient contact inside the magnet bore of the MR unit can transmit infection so cleaning requires an MRI staff member to travel on the table inside the bore to sanitize and disinfect the tunnel walls.
5. MRI magnet room cleaning schedule is available in your area

# MONITORING BY NURSING STAFF: CRITICAL CARE PATIENTS 

This policy conforms fundamentally with the policy developed jointly by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the American Association of Critical Care Nurses. Patients must be transported with the same level of monitoring required on the sending unit.

It is the responsibility of the health care team on the sending unit to assess the stability of the patient and assure personnel required for safe transportation.

- All ICU patients are to be transported to diagnostic procedures with a minimum of a RN and transporter
- All patients requiring cardiac monitoring are to be transported with a minimum of a RN and transporter
- Patients receiving blood or blood products must be accompanied by an RN
- Patients requiring restraints must be accompanied by an RN or PCA
- Any unstable patient who requires or is at risk for requiring acute intervention beyond the scope of nursing practice must be accompanied by an MD/LIP
- Non critical care personnel may provide transport for ICU patients deemed appropriate to travel without an RN or MD support. These patients must be transported without cardiac monitoring and a MD/LIP order is required indicating the patient may travel without cardiorespiratory monitoring

# MONITORING BY MRI STAFF FOR THERMAL INJURY 

Monitoring of patients is necessary in the MR scanner. The potential for thermal injury from possibly excessive radio frequency power deposition exists. Sedated, anesthetized and/or unconscious patients may not be able to express symptoms of such injury. Patients who require EKG monitoring and who are unconscious, sedated and/or anesthetized should be examined before scanning and after repositioning to ensure that MR safe EKG leads and any other electrically conductive material is not in contact with the patient or coiled so as to induce a current. For more on thermal injuries please refer to page 17.

The location of the Code Carts should be known by all MRI staff members. These will be checked daily by assigned MR staff for expired medications and functioning equipment.

1. It should be stressed that the magnetic field is Always ON. As in any emergency; it is the responsibility of appropriately trained and knowledgeable MRI personnel to ensure the safety of all non MRI personnel as well as that of patients and family.
2. In the event of a code:

YNHH Main Campus:

- Outpatients call 155 for outpatients, and say: Adult medical emergency for an adult, Pediatric medical emergency for a pediatric.
- Inpatients, 155
- North Haven Devine St call 911
- St Raphael Medical Campus call 155
- Shoreline Medical Center call 911
- Park Avenue/Trumbull. Call 911 and page overhead for help.

Give the appropriate location:
3. The patient will be removed from the scan room (zone 4) immediately and the scan room door closed and locked. MR staff members/nursing will transfer patient to nearest recovery area, get the code cart and start basic life support until the code

team arrives. Full resuscitative measures should not be undertaken in the scanner room (Zone 4).
4. Other MRI personnel can offer assistance; such as direct the code team to the right location
5. A radiologist should be notified that a code has been called if possible.
6. While the code is in progress it is imperative that all scanner doors be closed and monitored by MRI personnel to prevent any accidental entry which could result in injury.
7. When the code team arrives they are responsible for the patient. MRI personnel will maintain the safety of all staff in the magnetic environment.
8. After the code it is the responsibility of the MRI staff to call the pharmacy so that the code cart can be restocked as soon as possible.

# Remodulin (Treprostinil) Pumps 

Remodulin/Treprostinil is a continuous therapy that cannot be switched to the MR Conditional Iradimed Pumps. The pumps used are a specific type called a Legacy CAAD. These patients need to come down with a RN from the floor. The pump is kept outside the room and the extension tubing is ran through the waveguide hole in the MR room.

## Special Instructions

Remind the RN coming down to: (1) bring down enough extension tubing to run the pump outside the room (2)bring down enough medication to prime all the extensions and last the entire exam

## Patients Receiving Blood

When blood or any type of blood product is being administered IV there is always a risk of reaction to the product, these patients should always come down with a nurse. If an MRI is ordered with contrast and a reaction happens it may be difficult to distinguish which agent caused a potential allergy?

## Instructions

Non-contrast MRI--can come anytime, bloods needs to be monitored with a floor RN MRI using contrast- (routine priority) should wait for blood to be finished. This can occur immediately after the product is done with no time delay.

MRI using contrast- (urgent or life threatening priority) should not be delayed and can be scanned while blood product is still infusing. The benefit of the scan is felt to outweigh any risk of confusion with an allergic reaction in this setting.

As always, any pump or pole being used with the blood product must be MR-conditional if brought into zone 4.

## Artic Sun Protocol

Artic Sun is a therapy to regulate the bodies' temperature. It consists of gel pads that have temperature regulated water flowing through them. The pads are all over the patient's body and the water is regulated from a machine.

## Special Instructions

The machine is disconnected and left on the floor the pads can stay on the patient's body during an MRI scan. MRI staff should verify there are no defibrillator pads under the artic sun pads.

In the event of a ferrous object in the MR scan room, an evaluation of the situation must be done immediately.

If the object is inside the patient or in the imaging field:

1. Stop the scan and speak with the patient. If the object is identified, and can be removed safely (i.e. a bobby pin) do so with caution.
2. If the object is unidentified or is unsafe for the MRI (i.e. undocumented aneurysm clip) SLOWLY move the patient out of the magnet and slide them on to a stretcher. The patient should not sit up, and all movements should be slow until outside of the MRI room.

If the object is pinning a patient or staff member:
1a. If the person is unconscious, bleeding profusely, at risk of losing a limb or extremity, or in severe pain, you must manually quench the magnet to bring down the field in order to release the object and the person.

1b. If the person is responsive and able to tell you they feel OK, you may be able to leave them in the position until a service engineer can respond and ramp the magnet down slowly to avoid a full quench. If you choose the latter, and the person then loses consciousness, or their condition worsens, immediately quench the magnet manually.
2. Once the person is released, get them out of the room and obtain medical help, code procedure pg 91. The MRI manager, safety officer and medical director should be informed immediately. The event should be reported on RL solutions via the intranet and the www.fda.gov/medwatch website.

Due to the presence of a powerful magnetic field, the MRI environment can be dangerous for patients and staff. Precautions must be taken to assure that ferromagnetic materials/devices do not get close enough to the MRI scanner to pose a danger.

Any loose metallic objects or devices will be placed in a locker or some designated secure space in Zone I or II.

Interrogation with a ferromagnetic detector is an important part of the screening process for all individuals entering the MRI environment.

All non- MR personnel, patients, visitors, ancillary facility members and anyone else MR staff deem necessary, need to be evaluated by thorough "wanding" with ferromagnetic detector in Zone II before given permission to enter Zone III or Zone IV. This group includes but is not limited to nurses and PCA staff accompanying patients, environmental services, cardiology and anesthesia staff".

Employees who regularly work in MR do not need to be wanded. This group includes, but is not limited, to Radiologists, MR nursing, MR technologists and MR technical assistants.

All MR staff members can wand visitors, companions and facility staff members after appropriate training.

Exceptions to these policies may be made at the discretion of the supervising radiologist, such as in the rare instance of an acute, life-threatening condition, and after consultation with the referring health care professional. Potential exemptions include, but are not limited to, scanning a patient with a metallic foreign body of unknown composition, unknown active or passive implant, or waiving informed consent for a scan that would typically need it. Any exemptions should be taken seriously and the rationale for the exception must be documented by the supervising ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST in EPIC via the comments section for the exam protocol or via a written clinical note in the patients' medical record EPIC. A non-radiologist clinician cannot override any MRI safety policy unless there is co-documentation by the attending radiologist as noted above.

Some programmable shunts have pressure settings that may need to be known preMRI and verified post-MRI. Identify the shunt and its FDA approved process before imaging.

# Programmable Shunts that need to be checked 

An outpatient with a programmable shunt THAT NEEDS TO BE CHECKED must have an appointment set up before scanning. Not all programmable shunts need to be checked. The shunt settings should be checked within 24 hours by the patient's "shunt manager" (i.e. clinician, device rep).

An inpatient with a programmable shunt that needs to be checked must have a Neurosurgery consult before scanning. (i.e. Neurosurgery needs to be comfortable checking the shunt post MRI before we can image) PLEASE CONTACT NEUROSURGERY AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE TO COORDINATE (203 412 1030).

If the type of shunt is unknown, or we have incomplete records, gather as much information as possible and ask a Neuroradiologist (203 200 3181) to (1) confirm whether the shunt is programmable or non-programmable using shunt X-rays and (2) document in EPIC notes. Neurosurgery consult is available to the Neuroradiologist as

back-up. If both Neuroradiology and Neurosurgery are unable to confirm the type of shunt, the patient will be rescheduled.

# Intracranial Electrodes and MRI (Post Grid Protocol) 

The root cause of epileptic seizures can be difficult to find. A routine EEG using electrodes on the scalp surface may not locate the origin of a patient's seizures. In these cases, neurosurgeons may need to do more direct monitoring using intracranial electrodes such as subdural grid, strips and/or depth electrodes. The electrodes are placed in the operative room, and the patient undergoes post-operative imaging (MR/CT). They are continuously monitored for a length of time (typically less than 14 days) before the removal of the electrodes.

Some companies' (e.g. Ad-Tech) electrodes do not provide ASTM MRI labelling, but they have an excellent MR safety record with decades of clinical use and research testing. YNHH follows tailored guidelines that have been created based on our years of clinical experience, and published data on this topic.

Our MR guidelines are:

1- See guidance in composition section
The protruding leads need to be aligned straight and separated as much as the patients dressing allow.
The sequences performed will be kept to what is clinically necessary.

SUBJECT: Claustrophobia and Emotional Distress

Claustrophobia is defined as extreme or irrational fear of confined places. Many MRI patients feel a varying degree of claustrophobia and/or emotional distress. Having an MRI can have a stressful effect on a patient, in fact a patient might not know they suffer from claustrophobia until their first MRI experience.

Some techniques to combat claustrophobia and/or emotional distress are:
Before the MR exam:

- Prepare and educate the patient about their MR procedure (e.g., MR machine dimensions, noise and potential vibrations, table movements throughout the exam, coil positions and shapes, intercom system, constant presence of the MRI technologist).
- Allow an appropriately screened companion to remain with the patient during the MR examination.
- Position the patient feet first (if exam appropriate)

During the MR exam:

- Maintain verbal, visual, and/or physical contact with the patient during the MR procedure.
- Audio distractions: appropriate stereo system to provide music to the patient.
- Visual distractions: video monitor or goggles, mirrors or prism glasses to redirect the patient's line of sight, a blindfold so that the patient is not aware of the surroundings.
- Comforting environment: bright lights inside of the MR system, fan inside of the MR system.
- Use a sedative or other similar medication.
- Perform the scan as rapidly as possible and do the most important sequences first.

| MRI Safety Manual | SUBJECT: Tattoos Jewelry Body Piercings and Hair Extensions |  |  |

Below is our policy for Tattoos, Jewelry, Body Piercings and Hair Extensions
Tattoos:
Tattoo ink can contain products such as iron oxide that have potential to react with the RF field creating e-fields and in turn burns. Although this is highly unlikely, safety measures should still be put in place.

Before the Exam:

- Tattoos should be discussed with the patient.

During the Exam:

- Maintain verbal, and visual contact with the patient during the MR procedure.
- If the patient is uncomfortable at any point during the exam stop.

Jewelry/Dermal piercings and Magnetic Eyelashes
Before the MR Exam:

- All jewelry that can be removed, should be removed particularly pieces that are in the area of RF exposure.
- If the jewelry can't be removed easily, position it away from the skin as much as possible.
- Prepare and educate the patient about their MR procedure and potential vibrations felt around the jewelry from the magnet (even nonferrous metal can potentially vibrate during gradient excitation.)
- A tester magnet or a ferromagnetic wand can be used to determine if it is ferromagnetic.
- If it is ferromagnetic, a wrap such as coban or tape can be placed around the item to help prevent it from dislodging.

During the Exam:

- Maintain verbal, and visual contact with the patient during the MR procedure.
- If the patient is uncomfortable at any point during the exam stop.

Hair Extensions:
Occasionally the seams of the hairpiece extension include small amounts of metal that may produce an artifact. Others are semi-permanent and attached with hairpins.

Hairpins are typically elongated in shape, very small and highly ferrous. Not only can these pins become projectiles, they can get stuck in the small crevasses of a mechanical MR table, essentially putting the table out of service or creating an artifact that appears on all images until removed.

Before the MR exam:

- ALL hairpins need to be removed before proceeding with the MRI.
- Ask the patient to remove all hair pieces. Scan the patients head with a ferromagnetic detector to confirm no hair pins are present.

## YNHH Position on Static Field Gradients

In 2019 the ACR Committee of MR Safety addressed the confusion around the Static Field Gradient, and ASTM MR Conditional labeling.

When a device or implant receives MR Conditional labeling, one of the values assigned is the static field gradient (SFG), i.e. the magnetic field change over distance. Interpretations of this value has caused confusion.
Example of MR Conditional label: (Static Gradient Field of $720 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}$ or less)
Vendors provide SFG maps for each magnet. Many of the maps show SFG values higher than a specific device label. For example, you could have an implant that has a SFG rating of $720 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}$ or less and the maximum SFG on your MRI magnet is $1100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}$.

When reviewing SFG maps for determining safety of scanning an MR conditional implant, two things should be addressed for the magnet being used and the implant in question;
(1) Clinically accessible area
(2) Patient accessible area

Clinically Accessible Area:
The highest SFG areas are not clinically accessible. They are located behind the magnet housing (the plastic bore cover). Additional high SFG regions in front of the plastic covering are in an area utilized by staff not by patients.

Patient Accessible Area:
Patient accessible areas are rarely higher than the standard ASTM labeling ${ }^{2}$. In some instances, there is a high SFG at the very periphery of the bore.

![img-18.jpeg](images/img-18.jpeg.png)

Figure 1 shows a patient in position for a knee MRI. The Orange line identifies $7 \mathrm{~T} / \mathrm{m}(700 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm})$ SFG.

# Conclusion: 

We recognize that some MRI Magnets might have SFG ratings higher than what an implant or device is labelled to. We strive to keep all patients, as close to the table/gantry midline, as possible. This will keep the implant exposed to the lowest SFG necessary during the majority of the MRI exam.

# Appendix G 

## Passive Vascular Implant Background

## How do implants get tested?

For a passive implant to acquire a MR Conditional rating, a series of ASTM tests have to be performed. Two of those tests will be discussed below.

The F2052-15 test measures the deflection angle of an implant to see if gravitational forces or the B0 forces are more influential on the device. The test does not take into account any designed or naturally occurring counterforces once a device is implanted in the human body. Thousands of passive vascular devices mentioned above (coils, stents, and filters) have been tested and brought to market in the USA have passed this test at 1.5 and 3 Tesla. There are some devices that were brought to market before ASTM standards were created, and others before 3T scanners were in use. Based on additional testing or clinical research, most have had their labeling changed to include 3T. The YNHHS MRI Safety Committee feels the risk of harm is very low from MRI for a patient from any passive vascular device.

The F2182-11a test assesses the relationship between RF induced heating and the implant. This is the current standard, but is not very precise and likely is overconservative as it does not take into account the cooling effects of blood perfusion, which is known to have a major impact on heat reduction of passive vascular devices. The periphery of the RF transmission field is where maximum heating occurs. During testing, devices are placed in the area where heating would be maximized to show

worst case scenarios (usually the edges of the phantom), and the results may not reflect the situations in patients when passive vascular devices are not on the periphery, but more centered in the body/ field and therefore exposed to lower RF transmission energies.

How can we predict heating risk?

The standard method to predict heating in a passive implant is to monitor SAR (specific absorption rate) values. SAR is estimated by adding up all the RF pulses in a sequence, dividing by TR and then taking that number and dividing by the patient's weight (watts of power $/ \mathrm{kg}$ ). Burns are thought to be created within an area of the body with high resistance to "electron traffic". RF is introduced into the body and then dissipated by normal thermoregulatory systems. If there is an area where it cannot dissipate heat efficiently, an e-field is created ("energy pile-up"), and this is thought to produce a burn. However, the relationship between RF and e-field creation is not precise. While RF is a component of the SAR calculation, using SAR to predict burns caused by e-fields is indirect and difficult to foresee.

It is also important to note SAR levels received in the clinical setting are not accurate. Different manufacturers calculate SAR with different methods and exponents, and the SAR levels can even vary between software levels on the same MRI scanner. SAR reported at the clinical work station has been shown to be many times higher than actual values. The limitations of SAR values in clinical MRI are widely known in the MR community. A newer value called B1rms, which is not patient dependent, is being used

for active implant testing. This value is more accurate, but it's not the standard ASTM test for passive implant testing.

In clinical MRI there are two SAR settings "normal mode" and "first level". The large majority of passive vascular devices have a SAR value that can be satisfied by one of these two modes. There are a handful of devices that have a ASTM labeling with a SAR rating lower than the normal operating mode setting of $2 \mathrm{w} / \mathrm{kg}$. Given limitations of testing and SAR estimates, our policy is to always keep the SAR values as low as possible for diagnostic clinical images

Measures pulmonary artery pressure. Not sure if you guys have come across it? It's implanted in the pulmonary artery and looks similar to the leadless pacemaker and loop recorder.

![img-26.jpeg](images/img-26.jpeg.png)

The inductor coil and pressure-sensitive capacitor create a resonant circuit at a specific frequency. The blood pressure affects the resonant frequency, so that when the blood pressure changes, the resonant frequency changes. The external measurement system wirelessly tracks the resonant frequency and uses this to determine the pressure in the pulmonary artery.

## 2/14/19 MRI Process for the Mechanically Ventilated Adult Patient

- RT transports patient on cross vent to MRI holding area (Zone 1), transfers to wall oxygen and sets up cross vent on stand
- RT removes all metal (phones, pagers, badge, hair pins, etc) and is wanded prior to entering MRI Zone 3
- RT takes Servo-I ventilator to MRI scan room to gaussed area.
- Tethers vent to wall
- Hooks up medical gases
- Locks wheels
- Enters ventilator settings
- Attaches ETCO2
- Attaches NIF adapter and green tubing to auxiliary alarm outside scanner room
- While RT is setting up Servo-I ventilator, ICU nurse, MRI nurse and MRI tech are prepping patient (vital signs, IV pumps, etc)
- RT returns to holding area and patient is transported on cross vent to Zone 2B
- Nurse and patient are wanded to enter Zone 3
- Patient is transported into Zone 3 on cross-vent to doorway of Zone 4
- For "head first" entry into scanner room, cross vent and stand will remain at the foot of the stretcher minimizing risk of pull into scanner room
- For "feet first" entry into scanner room, cross vent and stand will remain at the head of the stretcher minimizing risk of pull into the scanner room
- RT takes Servo-I ventilator out of stand-by mode and circuit tubing is bought outside of scanner room and patient is transitioned to Servo-I ventilator.
- Time out is performed to confirm that patient is now being ventilated on the Servo-I ventilator.
- Patient is bought into scanner room, RT maintains airways as the patient is transferred onto scanner table and into the scanner.
- RT turns on auxiliary alarm and confirms positive pressure
- RT attaches ambu bag to wall oxygen in scanner room
- Team performs a verbal final check that patient is on ventilator, vital signs are stable and auxiliary alarm is in place
- Cross vent stand with oxygen tank are returned to MRI prep hold

End of Scan

- Cross vent stand with oxygen tank are returned to Zone 3 outside of scanner room
- Patient is removed from scanner and bought out of Zone 4 to Zone 3 with RT maintaining airway

- RT transitions the patient from the Servo-I to the cross vent.
- Time out is performed to confirm that patient is now being ventilated on the cross vent.
- The patient is returned to holding area and cross vent is attached to wall oxygen.
- RT returns to MRI scanner to remove Servo-I vent, cleaned, set up, tested and returned to Zone 3
- Patient is transported back to ICU

# Technical Details - Hoffmann ${ }^{\circledR}$ II MRI 

![img-30.jpeg](images/img-30.jpeg.png)

The MRI components have been tested according to ASTM Standards F2052, F2182, and F2213.

The color coding scheme illustrated below must be followed to ensure correct MRI usage.
![img-31.jpeg](images/img-31.jpeg.png)

These Straight and Curved Rods are designed for MRI use. They are color coded in YELLOW.
![img-32.jpeg](images/img-32.jpeg.png)

It has been shown by specific MRI tests that the Hoffmann ${ }^{\circledR}$ II MRI External Fixation System may be used for patients undergoing MRI procedures using up to 3.0 Tesla MR systems if certain specific conditions are followed.

Two commonly used frames have been tested for MRI use at 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla. The results are as follows:
![img-33.jpeg](images/img-33.jpeg.png)
1.5 Tesla MR System
$\nabla \mathrm{R}_{\max }: 31.4 \mathrm{~mT} / \mathrm{cm}$
$\Delta \mathrm{T}_{\max }: \quad 2.65^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $2.0 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{kg}$ at a whole body average SAR for MR imaging time of 6 minutes

### 3.0 Tesla MR System

$\nabla \mathrm{R}_{\max }: 70 \mathrm{~mT} / \mathrm{cm}$
$\Delta \mathrm{T}_{\max }: \quad 2.34^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $0.5 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{kg}$ at a whole body average SAR for MR imaging time of 6 minutes
![img-34.jpeg](images/img-34.jpeg.png)
1.5 Tesla MR System
$\nabla \mathrm{R}_{\max }: 31.4 \mathrm{~mT} / \mathrm{cm}$
$\Delta \mathrm{T}_{\max }: \quad 1.70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $2.0 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{kg}$ at a whole body average SAR for MR imaging time of 6 minutes

### 3.0 Tesla MR System

$\nabla \mathrm{R}_{\max }: 70 \mathrm{~mT} / \mathrm{cm}$
$\Delta \mathrm{T}_{\max }: \quad 2.56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $0.5 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{kg}$ at a whole body average SAR for MR imaging time of 6 minutes

In this testing, each of the frames shown above produced a temperature rise not greater than $3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for a maximum MR imaging time of 6 minutes. Tests have been performed using MR systems from different suppliers. Please note that the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) may be reported differently, e.g. as whole body averaged SAR or as partial SAR by the software depending on the MR system used.

Note:
These tests have been performed in areas where the greatest temperature increase is expected with commonly used frames. Due to the versatility of the system, an unlimited number of frames can be built which makes it impossible to test each and every construct.

Based on the test results, the Hoffmann ${ }^{\circledR}$ II MRI may be used in MRI procedures under the specified conditions. There are factors that can influence these results like the number of pins used in the clamps and the number of open and closed loops in the frame. Therefore, it is recommended that each frame be evaluated by a radiologist or MR scientist before the MRI procedure to ensure patient safety. Since different frame configurations and frame sizes might lead to higher temperature increases, Stryker recommends for patient's safety to minimize SAR settings as much as possible.

None of the components should move or migrate in the 1.5 or 3.0-Tesla MRI environments.
Non-clinical testing has not been performed to rule out the possibility of component movement or migration at static magnetic field strengths higher than 3.0 Tesla or maximum spatial gradients higher than 70.0 $\mathrm{mT} / \mathrm{cm}$.

MR image quality may be compromised if the area of interest is in the exact same area as or relatively close to the position of the frame or its individual components
