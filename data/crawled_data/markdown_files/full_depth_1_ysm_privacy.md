## Acceptance of Terms

Copy Link

Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms”) carefully before accessing or participating in any website or other online platform or service available on or through medicine.yale.edu, yalemedicine.org or other Yale School of Medicine or Yale Medicine sites (the “Site” or “Sites”). The Terms are an enforceable agreement between Yale University (“Yale”) and you, the user of the Sites, whether you are a student, faculty member, staff member, alumnus/a, group, association, corporation, patient, caregiver, physician, referring physician, or other individual or organization. Terms such as “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Yale University. By using and accessing the Sites, you acknowledge that you have read the Terms and agree to be bound by and comply with them. If you do not agree to be bound by and comply with the Terms, you are not authorized to use the Sites. Yale reserves the right to modify the Terms at any time in its sole discretion, and will publish notice of any such modifications on this site. Any modified Terms are effective immediately upon posting. By continuing to access any Site after Yale posts notification of modified Terms, you agree to be bound by and comply with them. **If you do not agree to the Terms, please do not enter the Sites. If you are not yet eighteen years of age, a parent or guardian may agree to be bound by the Terms on your behalf.**

Nothing in the Terms overrides the application of other rules and policies of Yale or other agreements between you and Yale. For example, your use of the Site is also subject to:

* [Privacy Statement for Yale Websites](https://www.yale.edu/privacy-policy)
* [HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices](https://hipaa.yale.edu/)
* [The Yale Information Technology Appropriate Use Policy](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/1607-information-technology-appropriate-use-policy)
* If you enter into any other agreement with Yale, for example regarding health plan coverage, then the Terms are in addition to the terms of such other agreement. Neither your acceptance of the Terms, nor visiting any Site, guarantees that you are eligible to receive coverage under any plan offered through any Site or otherwise.

## Medical Information

**If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should not rely on any information on the Site and should seek appropriate emergency medical assistance, such as calling “911”.** You should always talk to your health care professionals for diagnosis and treatment, including information regarding which drugs or treatment may be appropriate for you. Statements made by any persons on these Sites are not intended to substitute for discussion or evaluation with your health care professional or provide any guarantee as to outcomes. Nothing on these Sites represents or warrants that any particular drug or treatment is safe, appropriate or effective for you. Health information changes quickly. Therefore, you should always confirm information with your health care professionals.

The Sites are intended for a United States audience. If you live outside the United States, you may see information on the Sites about products or therapies that are not available or authorized in your country.

You may also print a reasonable number of copies of information and content available on or through the Sites for your personal, non-commercial and educational use only, provided that you reproduce all copyright, trademark and proprietary notices (for example, some Sites may include trademarks or logos belonging to third-party licensors and are used pursuant to an agreement with such third parties), and you comply with all other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to that material. Although parts of the Site are freely accessible, Yale does not intend to cede its respective rights, or the rights of third parties, to information and content available on or through the Sites. By accessing, downloading or printing information and content from any Site, you agree that there is no explicit or implicit transfer of ownership rights, and any and all rights, title and interest in and to the Sites, including all services, information and content available on or through the Sites, and all intellectual property rights, including all copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret rights therein, shall remain with Yale and our third-party licensors, as applicable. You may not otherwise copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, exploit or otherwise transfer any such information or content unless permission to do so is specifically granted by Yale. Because Yale does not hold the copyright to certain materials on the Sites, Yale cannot grant or deny permission to use those materials. Accordingly, you are solely responsible for determining the copyright status of any materials you may wish to use, to investigate the owner of the copyright, and to obtain permission for your intended use, if appropriate.

### Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement

Yale intends that all information and content on the Sites respect the copyright and other proprietary rights of third parties. However, Yale cannot monitor the copyright ownership of all such material. If you believe that any material posted on the Sites infringes your copyright, then you may request the removal of those materials from the Site in accordance with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), and the procedures described below.

A notice of infringing material that complies with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (“Notice”) must be sent to the agent Yale has designated with the Copyright Office:

**Chief Information Security Officer**
  
Yale University
  
150 Munson Street (25 Science Park)
  
Room 132
  
New Haven, CT 06511
  
Tel: (203) 436-5872
  
Fax: (203) 436-8292
  
[copyright@yale.edu](mailto:copyright@yale.edu)

To comply with the Copyright Act, your Notice must be in writing and must include the following:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Yale to locate the material;
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit Yale to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
5. A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and made under penalty of perjury, and that you are the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

When Yale receives a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, it will remove the identified material immediately. Yale will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the user who posted the allegedly infringing material (the “alleged infringer”) of the Notice and subsequent removal. The alleged infringer may then provide Yale with a counter-notice (“Counter-Notice”) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous. Such Counter-Notice must be in writing and must include:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer;
2. Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or access to it disabled as a result of error;
4. The alleged infringer’s name, address, and telephone number; and
5. A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents to service of process from the complaining party or its agent.

Upon receipt of a Counter-Notice, Yale will notify you of the Counter-Notice and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days of receipt of the Counter-Notice, unless you inform Yale that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.
