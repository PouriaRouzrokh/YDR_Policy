# Single Kidney

It has been shown that there are no significant differences in the rate of AKI attributable to contrast enhanced CT in patients with a solitary kidney versus two kidneys. Therefore, patients with a solitary kidney should receive the same amount of IV contrast as those with two kidneys. This can be edited at the discretion of the supervising radiologist in patients with compromised renal function.
