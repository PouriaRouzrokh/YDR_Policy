| Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging <br> Title: Formal Yale Radiology Consultation on Outside Studies | SOP 005.000 | Effective Date: <br> March 2022 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Version 2 | RAD Mission: Clinical |
| Prepared By: Regina Hooley and Jay Pahade MD |  | Date: March 2022 |
| Management Approval: Rob Goodman MD |  | Date: March 2022 |

# A. Purpose 

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the YDR policy for the formal interpretation and consultation of outside imaging studies (aka "outside $2^{\text {nd }}$ read requests"). The purpose of this practice is to help minimize the risk of harm to patients when clinical decisions are based on imaging findings performed outside YNHH. Performing an official consultation on outside studies also decreases additional radiation exposure and healthcare costs from repeat/duplicative exams. Institutions with similar policies have shown that a change in diagnosis occurs in approximately $8 \%$ of cases (Zan, E., Yousem, DM, et al. "Second-opinion Consultations in Neuroradiology." Radiology. 2010; 255(1): 135-41).

## B. Scope

1. Formal consultation and interpretations of outside studies may be requested for CT, MRI, and PET-CT scans less than $\underline{90}$ days old. Outside consultation requests for exams older than 90 days may be automatically canceled by Radiology Image Library staff.
2. Un-official "Curbside consults" should not be provided for CT, MRI or PET exams that are eligible for an outside read.
3. Outside studies being discussed at tumor boards or other multi-disciplinary conferences must be uploaded using the process outlined above if the study is less than 90 days old.
4. Imaging performed and interpreted at other YNHHS sites (Greenwich, Bridgeport, Lawrence & Memorial, Westerly) are also ELIGIBLE for outside consultation and interpretation by Yale Radiology unless the patient is currently an in-patient at the other YNHHS site. Smilow affiliated cancer sites such as St. Francis are also eligible. Exams performed at any Bridgeport Hospital facility locations that are read by a YDR radiologist are not eligible for outside read.

# C. Exemptions 

1. Formal consultation and interpretation of outside studies is not available for ultrasound, X-ray, and nuclear medicine exams (except PET-CTs).
2. Exams from the Veterans (VA) health system are not eligible. The radiologist should dictate a sentence stating study is not eligible.
3. Requests for consultation and interpretation of outside studies that have more recent or pending relevant imaging are exempt since the older exam will only be used as a reference when interpreting the newer study. Example- a CT spine does not have to be read if a newer MRI spine will also be read. The radiologist should dictate a sentence stating why second read is not performed.
4. Studies performed at Bridgeport Hospital out-patient sites and Shoreline/Hamden and RCPC YNHH radiology sites are NOT eligible as those exams are interpreted by Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging radiologists.

## E. Procedures

1. To generate a formal outside imaging interpretation (usually done by requesting MD and/or support staff) 3 methods are available:
   a. Using Powershare Software
   b. Using EPIC

   - For cases where images are already uploaded in PACS.
   - In EPIC order search bar type word "outside"
   - Chose the correct Outside Interpretation order for the study you are requesting to be read and provide relevant clinical history. Imaging of the brain or spine is handled by the neuroradiology section. Imaging of the abdomen and/or pelvis is handled by the body section.
   - Orders placed via EPIC but without images uploaded into PACS within 72 hours will be canceled by file room staff. A repeat order can be placed when images become available by ordering provider.
   c. Uploading a disc (If you do not have access to Life Image)
   - If you have a disc, you may drop it off at the Image Library (South or North Pavilion, second floor) to be uploaded.
   - Fill out the import request form provided by the Image Library Staff. Be sure to indicate on the form that you would like a secondary read.

2. Imaging will populate appropriate radiologist worklist after being processed by Radiology File room staff. All CT Chest/abdomen/pelvis exams will be split into 2 accessions for an outside read CT chest and outside read CT body.
3. The patient's insurance company will be billed for the professional component fee for Yale Radiology interpretation. RVUs will be generated for each report and assigned to the billing radiologist. Interpretations will be provided within 24 hours for in-patients and 48 hours for out-patient studies once available for radiologist dictation in PACS.
4. An outside read template is required for all reports. Templates are available in Powerscribe. This following statement should be in all reports for billing purposes. "This second interpretation is requested by the treating physician and the interpretation will directly contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient"
5. Inadequate studies, cases where adequate history is not available in order / EPIC, or cases that are not eligible for other reason still need a dictation generated stating why study will not be read.
   a. Do not dictate anything about billing the patient in your report. This will be handled by our billers.
6. Patients whose cases are presented at tumor board by affiliate community Smilow Care Cancer physicians (ex. St. Francis Smilow physicians) will not be billed.
   a. The case will not be submitted for payment by our billing department who has list of the qualifying community physicians in-order to encourage presentation of their cases at the tumor board without added costs. Cases presented by YNHH Smilow physicians are eligible and will be billed.

# Appendix 

How to place an order for an outside read on studies already loaded into PACS from an outside hospital:

1. Open patient's folder in EPIC.
2. Open orders.
3. Search for orders containing the word 'outside':

4. Select the correct outside study type ONLY from the list shown:

5. Complete the clinical details requested and 'accept'. If no clinical reasons for the exam are entered, the request may be refused at the discretion of the radiologist.
