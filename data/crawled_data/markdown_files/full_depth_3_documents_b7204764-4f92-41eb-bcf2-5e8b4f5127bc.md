# PURPOSE 

To provide guidelines for the use of intravenous or oral, iodinated and gadolinium based contrast media, as well as the proper response of Radiology staff in the event of a contrast media event.

## RESPONSIBILITY

1. IV and oral contrast media agents are considered medications according to the Joint Commission and, therefore, all adherences to the Medication Management Standards and all applicable YNHH drug use policies apply.
2. The patient's physician, PA, or APRN is responsible to order radiology exams, including those that require contrast media, either by written requisition or via computer order entry system. Inpatient and ED requests for contrast exams must include the patient's pregnancy status and renal function as appropriate.
3. The radiologist has primary responsibility to review pertinent, available patient history, including eGFR levels when applicable, and the appropriateness of the request for contrast media. The dose and the type of contrast administered will usually be pre-assigned per protocol performed.
4. Per YDR and DR administration, the responsibility to protocol CT exams with contrast is limited to radiology physicians and/or advanced practitioners, unless exam is eligible for autoprotocol. For exams ordered with IV contrast, the patient's eGFR should be $\geq 30$. If the eGFR is < 30, should follow low eGFR workflow as follows:
a. eGFR results for inpatient and ED patients should be within 48 hours. All inpatients and ED patients require a results value in order to proceed with contrast administration unless exam is eligible for eGFR bypass.
b. Please note, any outpatient that answers "Yes" to a renal risk factor question on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire requires a renal function assessment. Those patients without risk factors do not require renal testing prior to receiving IV contrast. Patients will be given a Point of Care (POC) eGFR test to determine eGFR level if no eGFR value is available within 6 weeks in Epic. eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist.
5. All personnel involved in the administration of contrast media are responsible to be aware of the steps that can be taken to anticipate a contrast reaction in order to prevent it, or if one occurs, recognize it and take appropriate measures. See Addendum 1.15A Recognition and Response to Contrast Reaction.
6. eGFR Workflow and Responsibilities for CT
a. If a CT study is ordered WITH contrast and eGFR is over 30, exam can be protocoled with IV contrast
b. If a CT study is ordered with a Life/Limb Threatening priority, is a full trauma, or a stroke code, eGFR testing is not required prior to imaging
c. If a CT study is ordered WITH contrast and eGFR is below 30 when patient arrives:
i. Technologist will call the appropriate reading room to notify a radiologist. Radiologist then has to review the case and decide how to proceed as below:
7. Give contrast despite eGFR <30: A few studies have shown NO added risk of deterioration of renal function with IV contrast compared to matched controls regardless of renal function $(2,3,5)$, however one study showed higher risk with eGFR $<30$ (1). If you have any doubt on the best choice, discuss with ordering provider and document reasoning in your report.
8. Change to CT WITHOUT contrast: If clinical question can be answered

sufficiently without IV contrast, document the following in your dictation. Example, "Current study was initially ordered with IV contrast, however the patient's eGFR on 'date X' was 'X.' Thus, the exam was switched to without IV contrast to eliminate risk of renal injury.
a. For Technologist: Place 52 Modifier on exam and e-mail 52Limited.Imaging@ynhh.org describing why the exam is being changed to without IV contrast.
3. Exam should be canceled/rescheduled: If exam canceled, Clinical Scheduling Assistant (CSA) will note the cancel reason as "lab function out of range" in the order history in Epic.
ii. Technologist should document in Epic study notes the name of radiologist who made the decision. If radiologist is ever unclear on what to do, they should discuss case with ordering provider.
iii. If order is being CHANGED (to without contrast or canceled), then Technologist will communicate the radiologist's decision to CSA and ask CSA to contact the ordering physician's office.

1. CSA, working from an approved script, will communicate the information to the ordering provider (or ordering provider's staff) including the eGFR value and the radiologist's recommendation for the patient's imaging.
a. If the ordering provider does not agree with the radiologist's decision, CSA will connect provider to radiologist for discussion. CSA will wait for further direction from the radiologist and/or technologist once that call is completed.
b. If the ordering provider agrees with the radiologist decision, the CSA will edit exam order with ordering provider using the following procedure:
i. If changing to CT WITHOUT contrast:
2. Epic Provider:
a. CSA will change the order in Epic to a noncontrast exam and send the order via Epic in-basket request for co-sign
b. CSA will track the order to ensure co-sign is received
3. Non-Epic Provider:
a. CSA will change the order in Epic to a noncontrast exam
b. CSA will request a new requisition from the ordering physician
c. CSA will track to ensure the new requisition is received
d. CSA will upload the new requisition into the Media Manager section of Epic
e. Regardless of Epic or non-Epic provider, CSA will contact PFAS
(PFASDrChanges@ynhh.org) to alert the pre-service team of the change in procedure code
f. Pre-service team will address any issues with authorization

g. CSA to track each order code via the change order excel
ii. If cancelling the exam:

1. CSA will cancel the appointment in Epic and take direction from the ordering physician's office about reschedule
c. If CSA cannot get in touch with ordering physician (or surrogate), the radiologist's decision will prevail. It is crucial that all our reports have documentation for reasoning to give or withhold contrast for this reason

# PROCEDURE GUIDELINES FOR INTRAVENOUS (IV) CONTRAST 

1. Intravenous contrast will be injected through an intravenous line previously established by the nurse or technologist. See DR Policy Medication Administration by Technologists in Diagnostic Radiology.
2. Prior to the administration of IV contrast, the patient's history including medications, allergies, and questions screening for renal impairment will be reviewed by the technologist in the patient's medical record, or obtained using the appropriate outpatient questionnaire, and subsequently scanned or entered into the medical record.
a. If no contraindications to contrast are noted, the technologist proceeds with IV contrast administration as per protocol identified by the radiologist.
b. If contraindications are noted, the case is referred to the radiologist for further consideration.
c. An IV line will stay in place during the examination, should IV drug therapy be necessary.
d. A physician, APP or RN must be on site during the contrast administration.
e. A contrast reaction kit and emergency equipment (including a code cart if a hospital site) must be readily available.

## POINT OF CARE TESTING

1. Point of Care testing will be performed by the technologist/technologist aid or nursing as required for outpatients (and rarely for inpatients) at the time of the appointment. This test is inspected by the College of American Pathologists as part of the accreditation of the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Yale New Haven Hospital. The meter will diagnose the quantitative measurement of creatinine in capillary, venous, and arterial whole blood. eGFR may be calculated by meter or via EHR to evaluate renal function.
2. Point of Care meter will be maintained by the MRI and CT scan departments and a QA schedule will be strictly adhered to. Staff will be trained in the use of the meter during their orientation and reviewed for annual competency. Training will be performed by the Department of Laboratory Medicine.
3. Point of Care Renal Function Testing in Radiology
a. MRI Patients
i. Please see MRI safety manual for full details
b. CT Patients
i. Any outpatient that answers "Yes" to the contrast related questions on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire will be given point of care testing to determine eGFR level if no eGFR/Cr value is available within 6 weeks.

ii. eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist as detailed above.

# PRE-MEDICATION POLICY FOR PRIOR ALLERGIC LIKE REACTIONS TO CONTRAST MEDIA 

| For Planned Administration of Contrast Agents: |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Previous reaction to allergens (eg shellfish, peanuts, medications, etc): |  |  |
| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| None | None | None |

Previous reaction to same class of contrast agent going to be given:

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | Pre-medicate and use different agent | Do not give contrast* |

Previous reaction to a different class of Contrast agent than type to be given:

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | None | None |

*Unless in the opinion of the responsible health care professional and supervising radiologist, the potential benefits outweigh the risks i.e. emergency situations.
In these instances, clinical provider should accompany the patient to radiology suite (whenever feasible) to aid in management if a repeat reaction occurs.

Premedication with steroids and Benadryl is now recommended only for patients who have had a reaction to contrast of a similar class (iodinated agents used during CT are one class, gadolinium based agents used during MRI are separate class) to the one planned to be given. Prophylaxis for those with reactions to other allergens is no longer necessary.

This guideline has been drawn up based on the following information:

- Current estimated overall reaction risk in the general population of children and adults is less than $1 \%$ (in range of $0.2-0.6 \%$ ) (Wang et al., Dillman et al.)
- Patients with a prior reaction to the same class of contrast agent being administered are known to be at highest risk for repeat reaction, $3-11 \%$ overall reaction rate with $2 \%$ breakthrough reaction rate even with pre-medication during CT (Mervak et al. Lasser et al).
- The current standard of care in the United States is to pre-medicate patients with steroids and antihistamine to decrease risk of repeat contrast reaction in patients who have had a reaction in the past to a similar class contrast agent.
- An IV steroid regimen (Recommended regimen below) is likely non-inferior compared to a longer PO regimen and is therefore recommended in the ED and in-patient setting to expedite imaging when needed (Mervak et al)

# Exclusions 

- In certain clinical circumstances the urgency of a contrast enhanced CT or MRI may outweigh the benefits and time needed to complete approved premedication protocol, necessitating that contrast medium be given in absence of premedication or with a variation in the pretreatment protocol. This determination should be jointly agreed upon by supervising radiologist and ordering clinician and potentially the patient (if feasible) with documentation in medical record.


## Allergic Like Reaction Definitions ${ }^{1}$ :

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Limited urticaria ${ }^{2} /$ pruritis $^{2}$ | Diffuse urticaria / pruritis | Diffuse edema, or facial edema with dyspnea |
| Nasal congestion | Diffuse erythema, stable vital signs | Diffuse erythema with hypotension |
| Cutaneous Edema | Facial edema without dyspnea | Laryngeal edema with stridor and/or hypoxia |
| Sneezing / conjunctivitis / rhinorrhea | Throat tightness or hoarseness without dyspnea | Wheezing / bronchospasm, significant hypoxia |
| Limited "itchy"/"scratchy" throat | Wheezing / bronchospasm, mild or no hypoxia | Anaphylactic shock (hypotension + tachycardia) |

${ }^{1}$ Physiologic reactions like nausea, vomiting, feeling of warmth are unlikely to benefit from pre-medication
${ }^{2}$ If the urticaria/pruritis required medical treatment it should be considered moderate severity.

## Pre-medication Order Set is Linked to Epic Order Entry

This patient has an allergy recorded in EPIC to the type of contrast media used during this exam.

| Reaction severity | Recommendation |
| :-- | :-- |
| Prior reaction was NOT allergic-like (includes <br> nausea/vomiting, feeling of warmth) | Remove contrast agent from patient allergies. |
| MELD (includes hives NOT requiring <br> treatment, "scratchy/itchy" throat NOT <br> requiring treatment) | Do not require premedication. |
| MODERATE (includes hives requiring <br> treatment, wheezing) | Should receive premedication. |
| SEVERE (includes anaphylaxis, severe <br> laryngeal edema, hypoxia) | Consider alternative diagnostic test. Only order <br> after risk benefit discussion with supervising <br> radiologist. Should receive premedication. |

## Diagnostic Radiology Contrast Premedication Guideline YNHHS

If you need to further investigate this patient's allergy you can always regain access to this pre-medication order set by typing "Contrast reaction" in epic order set search bar.

| Open Order Set | Do Not Open | Out-patient contrast reaction pre-medications Preview |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Order | Do Not Order | Inpatient/ED contrast reaction pre-medications |

Order set can also be found manually by searching using the work "Contrast" in Epic
![img-0.jpeg](images/img-0.jpeg.png)

# What do I do if patient is allergic to a drug in the pre-medication order set? 

Alternate premedication can be used if the patient is known to tolerate other classes of steroids. If needed, allergy consult may be needed for proper skin prick testing to find a suitable alternate (in many cases, the patient is not allergic to the drug itself but an additive in the drug).
For allergies to Benadryl, alternate antihistamine can be used that patient is known to tolerate.
Possible PO alternate steroid regime is 32 mg methylprednisolone 12 h and 2 h prior to IV contrast administration
Possible PO alternate antihistiamine is Claritin or Zyrtec 10mg PO 1h prior to IV contrast
administration.

## Pre-medication Policy for Non-Vascular Administration of Contrast in Patients with Contrast Allergy

Patients with a history of severe "allergy" to a class of contrast agents (iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast agents) could develop a severe repeat reaction even with non-vascular administration of small amounts of that class of contrast. While case reports exist for patients experiencing "allergies" with non-vascular administration of contrast media, most papers have shown risk of repeat reaction to be low with non-vascular administration (even without premedication). Given this, the following approach is suggested:

- Use alternate class of contrast when feasible (example- barium).
- Gather information on what contrast agent caused the allergic-like reaction. Use a different agent whenever feasible. For some non-vascular injections, older high osmolar iodinated contrast agents can be substituted as these are rarely given IV anymore (examplegastrogaffin, conray, etc) to reduce risk of repeat exposure to same contrast agent.
- For iodinated contrast "allergy", off-label use of gadolinium-based agents can also be pursued depending on procedure.

Guidance on need for premedication (steroid/antihistamine) if being exposed to same class of contrast media that caused allergic-like reaction is detailed below.

| Premedication guidelines for previous reaction (by severity) to intravascular contrast and in need for non-vascular exposure of same contrast type |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Reaction Severity | Mild reaction <br> (ex. Hives) | Moderate reaction <br> (ex. Bronchospasm <br> needing treatment) | Severe reaction (i.e.- <br> anaphylactoid) |
| Premedication Recc. | None | Not routinely needed unless strong patient/clinician preference | Avoid giving contrast. If must be given, use standard premedication regimen* and be prepared to manage repeat reaction |

*Unless in the opinion of the responsible health care professional and supervising radiologist, the potential benefits of not performing premedication outweigh the risks (i.e. emergency situation and cannot wait for urgent procedure). In these instances, clinical provider should accompany the patient to radiology suite (whenever feasible) to aid in management if a repeat reaction occurs. Attempt to find what contrast agent caused the event and use a different agent.

## DOCUMENTATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS

1. If a contrast event occurs, the radiology nurse or technologist involved must document the details within the patient medical record (Epic). Allergy should be entered into Epic with details on what occurred and severity of reaction. The specific type of contrast used that triggered possible allergic reaction should be documented in the allergy notes in the medical record. A progress / evaluation note can also be placed by nursing in chart. The following details should be documented:
a. Contrast agent/dose administered
b. Reaction signs/symptoms
c. Patient management, including drugs administered
d. Patient outcome
e. Discharge instructions sheet
2. Details concerning the administration of contrast and the adverse event should be documented in the radiology report by the radiologist whenever possible.
3. Techs must also enter a report in SAFER Event Reporting System
4. At the radiologist's discretion, the patient's clinician may also be notified.
5. For any out-patient contrast related events (like extravasation or allergic like reaction) patient should be monitored for at least 30-60 minutes to ensure no worsening.

# PROTOCOL FOR EXTRAVASATED CONTRAST MATERIAL 

Modified from the ACR Manual of Contrast Media Manual

## Background

Extravasated iodinated contrast media is hyperosmolar and toxic to the surrounding tissues. Most patients recover without sequelae but severe adverse events may occur. Extravasation produces an acute local inflammatory response that peaks at 24-48 hrs although ulceration and tissue necrosis may occur as early as 6 hours after the extravasation. Extravasation of a large volume of contrast material can produce a compartment syndrome.

## Evaluation and Treatment

- All patients in which an extravasation has occurred should be evaluated by a radiologist from the service that would be reading the exam.
- For any out-patient contrast related events (like extravasation or allergic like reaction) patient should be monitored for at least 30-60 minutes to ensure no worsening.
- Elevation of the extremity and a cold or warm compress should be applied to the site up to four times/day for 1-3 days. Warm compress is preferred in acute phase as may be associated with quicker swelling resolution with cold compress used after initial event if patient prefers.
- If the symptoms improve or the patient remains asymptomatic, they may be sent home but told to go immediately to an ER if symptoms deteriorate or if there are skin/neurologic changes (ulceration, blistering, change in sensation).
- If symptoms have not improved after 2 hours or skin/neurologic changes develop, the patient should be referred to the emergency room.
- For inpatients, the extremity should be elevated and a warm compress should be applied (as above). Inpatients may be sent back to the floor but the house staff must be notified of the incident.
- A plastic surgical consult is frequently not necessary and a reliance of a volume threshold for surgical consultation is unreliable. In general, the need for surgical consultation should be made on the basis of the patient's signs and symptoms.
- An immediate plastic surgical consultation is indicated with the following:
- Increasing swelling/pain after 2-4 hours.
- Altered tissue perfusion as evidenced by decreased capillary refill
- Change in sensation of the affected limb
- Skin ulceration or blistering.


## Documentation

- All extravasation events should be documented in the radiology report and the referring physician should be notified.
- The technologist is responsible to ensure that the extravasation incident is documented in Event Reporting system.

ACR Reference on Contrast Extravasations
"There is no clear consensus regarding effective treatment for contrast medium extravasation. Elevation of the affected extremity above the level of the heart to decrease capillary hydrostatic pressure and thereby promote resorption of extravasated fluid is recommended, but controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of this treatment are lacking. There is no clear evidence favoring the use of either warm or cold compresses in cases of extravasation. As a result, there are some radiologists who use warm compresses and some who use cold compresses. Those who have used cold have reported that it may be helpful for relieving pain at the injection site. Those who have used heat have found it helpful in improving absorption of the extravasation as well as in improving blood flow, particularly distal to the site"

# Contrast Extravasation Discharge Instructions 

(FORMERLY Addendum I.15C)

During your test today, you had intravenous contrast material extravasation. This means that some of the IV fluid or contrast material went into the tissues of your arm/hand. This may cause swelling and discomfort. The fluid will be absorbed by your tissues and any symptoms should go away.

The contrast material used was $\qquad$

The approximate amount of extravasation was $\qquad$

## Treatment:

- Try to keep the affected extremity elevated above the level of the heart as much as possible.
- You can apply either warm or cold compresses for 15 minutes a few times a day for 3 days or until the symptoms resolve.

Seek immediate medical attention if:

1. your swelling or pain do not improve
2. your skin blisters
3. there is increased firmness at the site
4. your arm or an area on your arm or hand becomes red
5. you experience a change in sensation of your hand or arm such as numbness and tingling

# Radiology Policy Regarding Simultaneous Infusion of Blood Products and Contrast Media 

Blood transfusion and all blood related products including FFP, platelets, and other cryoprecipitates play a vital role in patient care. Like drugs, these substances may also elicit allergic like reactions and immune responses that can potentially mimic reactions induced by IV injection of iodinated AND gadolinium-based contrast media used during CT and MRI scans respectively. In conjunction with Yale/YNHH Transfusion Medicine Services, a joint agreement was made to limit CT and MRI scans WITH CONTRAST for patients actively receiving ANY blood product to STAT or LIFE-THREATENING PRIORITY. For these studies, it is felt that the information provided by the rapid imaging outweighs any potential risk and/or uncertainty on which substance may have caused a reaction.

All other scans should be delayed until after the infusion is completed to avoid any misinterpretation of a contrast reaction from a blood product reaction and vice versa. These studies can be performed immediately after the infusion is complete if necessary.

# Policies Specific to CT Contrast Media 

## Procedure Guidelines for ORAL Contrast (All Patients)

1. Prior to the administration of oral contrast, the patient's clinical history including medications, allergies and sensitivity and drugs, will be reviewed by the technologist in the patient's medical record, or obtained using the appropriate outpatient questionnaire, and subsequently scanned or documented into the patient's medical record.
2. If no contraindications are noted, the technologist proceeds with oral contrast administration as per protocol identified by the radiologist
3. All patients routinely receive an iohexol (Omnipaque ${ }^{\circledR}$ ) in water mixture, prepared according to the radiologist protocol, labeled with patient's demographics and provided to the patient or nurse with instructions for administration
4. An oral barium sulfate solution may be used for patients allergic to iodinated contrast at technologist discretion. Radiologist can be consulted when needed.
5. Patient imaging will begin approximately 45 minutes after the patient begins drinking oral contrast. Extended oral preparation may be prescribed by the radiologist at their discretion based on exam indication.
6. A contrast reaction kit and emergency equipment (including code cart, if a hospital site) must be readily available.
7. For inpatients: labeled oral contrast will be delivered to the inpatient floor for administration to the patient by their nursing team. For ED patients: contrast will be picked up in Radiology by member of patient's ED nursing team.

## Metformin and lodinated Contrast Information for patients

This fact sheet provides instructions on how to take your oral diabetes medications containing Metformin after you receive iodinated contrast dye for a CT scan.

## Diabetes medications that contain metformin include:

- Metformin (Glucophage/Glucophage XR, Glumetza, Riomet, Fortamet)
- Alogliptin/metformin (Kazano)
- Canagliflozin/metformin (Invokamet/Invokamet XR)
- Dapagliflozin/metformin (Xigduo XR)
- Empagliflozin/metformin (Synjardy/Synjardy XR)
- Ertugliflozin/metformin (Segluromet)
- Glipizide/metformin (Metaglip)
- Glyburide/metformin (Glucovance)
- Linagliptin/metformin (Jentadueto/Jentadueto XR)
- Pioglitazone/metformin (Actoplus Met/Actoplus Met XR)
- Repaglinide/metformin (Prandimet)
- Rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandamet)
- Saxagliptin/metformin (Kombiglyze XR)
- Sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet/Janumet XR)
- Vildagliptin/metformin (Eucreas)


## Why should I be taking my metformin differently?

In rare instances, Metformin can cause a severe side effect called lactic acidosis. This may occur more frequently in patients with decreased kidney function. Decreased kidney function is apparent when your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Contrast dye can increase the chances of metformin causing lactic acidosis in patients with decreased kidney function.

## What should I do?

If you have decreased kidney function (eGFR less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ):

- Stop taking metformin or metformin-containing products and contact your doctor within 48 hours before restarting.
- Bring this form with you to the doctor.

If you do not have decreased kidney function (eGFR $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ or greater):

- Continue taking metformin as originally prescribed.


## Questions or concerns

If you have any questions or concerns, talk tp your doctor or pharmacist.

Low-osmolar iodinated contrast has been shown to have a weak association with exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis-related symptoms, most commonly respiratory compromise. This association has been discussed with Yale Neurology who feel that the low risk does not merit screening patients for Myasthenia at this point. If a patient declares himself or herself as suffering from Myasthenia Gravis, our policy should be to reassure them that it is highly unlikely that any deterioration in symptoms will occur.

# RADIOLOGY (CT or MRI) TECHNOLOGIST: Policy for Power Injection 

** CVDs with TPN infusions cannot be used for contrast injection unless TPN has been disconnected

and vigorously flushed by RN prior to exam, before patient leaves the floor.
NOTE: No IV medication drips should be stopped or restarted without an RN's help. Injector should not be used with any IV that has questionable patency. If in doubt, question the radiologist or the patient's care givers.
CVD's - Adult use

| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Non- Marked Piccs | NO |  |  |  |

# PROCESS 

1. Following Hand Hygiene Policy at all times: wash or Purell, don gloves, when completed remove gloves, then wash or Purell.
2. RN must access and de-access all indwelling Ports - CVD lumen access may be performed by the CT technologist to inject contrast.
3. Prior to use: All CVAD lines used for contrast with injector or hand injection must have a 15 sec. hub scrub with approved disinfectant and allowed to air dry (minimum 15 sec .). (All CVD's must be checked for patency and blood return, using a 10 cc saline syringe with 3 cc removed. Flush line with 10 cc sterile saline after. A CVD should not be used without verification of blood return.
4. CT Technologist should monitor injection site for the duration of injection when possible.
5. The contrast for all CVD's is Omnipaque 350. If prior contrast reaction to Omnipaque, alterative agent like Isovue 370 may be used)

## SCRIPT

Adult Power Hickman - In-Patients: Call the floor to check IV status. If the RN states the patient has a Hickman two (2) questions need to be asked:

1. Is the Hickman a Power Hickman (Needs to be labeled on the clamp with maximum injection rate, if not Is a P or an X seen within the line on the Chest X-Ray or is there documentation in EPIC.
2. Has there been TPN running?
a. If Yes: to flush vigorously now and Disconnect TPN and to clearly mark lumen used for TPN.
b. Send patient with no meds running. (Open flush is allowed)
c. Instruct RN that the patient will return without the catheter being flushed with heparin.
d. If the TPN cannot be stopped and flushed before leaving the floor, the Hickman may not be used for the contrast injection.
e. Follow 15 second hub scrub and allow to air dry (min. 15 seconds).
f. Do not disconnect injector prior to exam completion or the hub scrub will need to be repeated.
g. Maximum flow rate will be listed on the lumen clamp.

Power Hickman: Out- patient: Follow 15 sec. hub scrub and allow to air dry (minimum 15 sec .) Maximum flow rate will be listed on the lumen clamp. Do not disconnect injector prior to exam completion or the hub scrub will need repeating. Call South Pavilion Core IR RN, Prep Hold RN, or RN in your respected area's to flush heparin post injection per YNHH policy.

Injection Rate for Use of PEDIATRIC Peripheral IV Injections
(For Neck/Foot veins see chart above)

| Lumen Size | Max Flow Rate | PSI |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 18 g, 20 g IV access | $5 \mathrm{cc} / \mathrm{sec}$ | 300 |
| 22 g IV access | $3 \mathrm{cc} / \mathrm{sec}$ | 200 |
| 24 g IV access | $1.5 \mathrm{cc} / \mathrm{sec}$ | 100 |

PEDIATRIC CENTRAL LINES INCLUDING BROVIAC
***Only Pediatric Central Lines 4 French (around 24G) or larger should be used for contrast injections.***
Gauge: Higher number= smaller line
French: Higher number= bigger line
Many neonate PICC's are between 1.5-3F and have a high chance of being damaged by a contrast injection. They should not be used unless approved by radiologist and ordering attending provider

Pedi- All Central Lines including Broviac: In- Patients: Call the RN. Instruct RN to accompany the patient. Pedi RN will need to follow YNHH hub scrub policy. Pedi RN will hub scrub and access the pediatric patient's Central Line and the technologist will connect the contrast. Omnipaque 350 may be injected @ 1 cc / sec. at 100 PSI. With the help of the CT Tech, the Pedi RN will disconnect the injector and follow YNHH heparin flush policy.

Pedi Broviac: Outpatient: Call Out Patient Pedi Nursing (follow same process as above)

# CT Intraosseous (IO) Iodinated Contrast Injection Policy 

IO lines may be used for power injection of iodinated contrast for CT

1. Flush IO line with 20cc IO saline. If IO line does not flush easily, do not use.
2. If Patient is unconscious, no analgesia is required. If patient is conscious and responsive to pain, IO $2 \%$ epinephrine free lidocaine should be administered (nursing/provider responsibility) just prior to contrast as per the protocol below:

## ADULT:

- Prime EZ-Connect extension set with lidocaine Note that the priming volume of the EZConnect is approximately 1.0 ml .
- Slowly infuse lidocaine 40 mg IO over 2 minutes.
- Allow lidocaine to dwell in IO space for 1 minute.
- Flush with 5 to 10 mLs of normal saline.
- Slowly administer and additional 20 mg of lidocaine IO over 1 minute.


## Pediatric:

- Usual dose is $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, not to exceed 40 mg .
- Prime EZ-Connect extension set with lidocaine.
- Note that the priming volume of the EZ-Connect is approximately 1.0 ml .
- Slowly infuse lidocaine over 2 minutes.
- Allow lidocaine to dwell in IO space for 1 minute.
- Flush with 2-5 mLs of normal saline.
- Slowly administer subsequent lidocaine (half the initial dose) IO over 1 minute.

3. Hook power injector tubing directly to IO line hub.
4. Inject contrast through IO line. No guidelines exist on rates for injection so use lowest injection rate possible (up to $5 \mathrm{cc} / \mathrm{sec}$ ) for the study and do not exceed 300 psi.
5. Disconnect power injector tubing from the IO line hub and flush the IO line with 20 cc IO saline.

# Procedure for Air Eliminating Filters \& IV Contrast Injections 

Air eliminating filters (as seen below) are connected to patients' IV lines who have a history of patent foramen ovale (PFO) or other clinically relevant right to left shunt. Any air introduced into the body of these patients could result in a serious reaction. Air eliminating filters are not compatible with IV contrast power injectors. These injectors can create very high pressures in the IV lines and the filters are not approved to use in this clinical setting as they could get damaged.

PFOs and the presence of an air eliminating filter are not a contraindication to the injection of intravenous contrast for a Radiology study.

The following procedure should be followed for patients with an Air Eliminating Filter:

1. If a patient arrives to the department with an air eliminating filter attached to their IV, contact floor RN (or other RN if unavailable) before proceeding. Let RN know that filter will have to be removed to perform a scan with IV contrast. Ask that the RN confirm with the ordering provider that a CT scan with IV contrast is still needed. A Radiologist can also be consulted to discuss alternate tests if ordering provider not sure on best test/approach.
2. An RN should remove filter from existing IV or start a new peripheral IV without a filter for use during contrast injection.
3. Check and ensure all air bubbles have been purged from power injector syringes/tubing. Whenever feasible, a second technologist should check as well before proceeding.
4. Perform exam as protocoled.
5. Once exam is finished, have RN re-connect the filter to patient's IV if previously removed.

# Injection Policy for Patients with a Single Kidney 

It has been shown that there are no significant differences in the rate of AKI attributable to contrast enhanced CT in patients with a solitary kidney versus two kidneys. Therefore, patients with a solitary kidney should receive the same amount of IV contrast as those with two kidneys. This can be edited at the discretion of the supervising radiologist in patients with compromised renal function.

McDonald JS et al. Radiology 278;74-81:2016

## Patients undergoing dialysis therapy who require IV iodinated contrast

For patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on long-standing dialysis, iodinated contrast can be used safely. In this setting, residual renal recovery is presumed to be lost and therefor any potential nephrotoxic effect of contrast should not have substantial impact on patient outcome. There is no need to initiate dialysis immediately after receiving IV contrast. Timing of next dialysis session can be decided by patient's nephrologist.

Risk-benefit discussion is needed between radiologist and clinical team members if the patient is on dialysis and there is a chance of recovering renal function or the patient is on dialysis but is still making reasonable amount of urine. In this setting iodinated contrast should be avoided (but is not absolutely contra-indicated if a study is needed) to avoid any further injury to kidney.
