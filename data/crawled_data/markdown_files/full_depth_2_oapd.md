# Office of Academic & Professional Development

The Office of Academic and Professional Development (OAPD) is committed to helping faculty at Yale School of Medicine thrive in their research, educational, and clinical careers.

Through programs that offer mentoring and leadership development, our goal is to provide resources to support all faculty in the School of Medicine from the beginning of their Yale careers through their transition to senior faculty leaders. The Office oversees faculty development programs in all departments, and provides regular consultation to faculty as they progress through the academic life-cycle.

Training is provided to prepare faculty for many types of leadership opportunities throughout their career, using an integrated value-driven approach imbued with the standards of professionalism that represent the culture and values of the school. The OAPD also serves as the resource for consultation and oversight regarding professional behavior and academic and research integrity.

We invite you to explore our website to learn more about the many resources Yale School of Medicine offers to support its faculty. Nothing on this website supersedes what is delineated in the Yale University Faculty Handbook.
