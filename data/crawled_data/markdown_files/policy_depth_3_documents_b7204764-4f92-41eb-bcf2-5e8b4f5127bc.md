# PURPOSE 

To provide guidelines for the use of intravenous or oral, iodinated and gadolinium based contrast media, as well as the proper response of Radiology staff in the event of a contrast media event.

## RESPONSIBILITY

1. IV and oral contrast media agents are considered medications according to the Joint Commission and, therefore, all adherences to the Medication Management Standards and all applicable YNHH drug use policies apply.
2. The patient's physician, PA, or APRN is responsible to order radiology exams, including those that require contrast media, either by written requisition or via computer order entry system. Inpatient and ED requests for contrast exams must include the patient's pregnancy status and renal function as appropriate.
3. The radiologist has primary responsibility to review pertinent, available patient history, including eGFR levels when applicable, and the appropriateness of the request for contrast media. The dose and the type of contrast administered will usually be pre-assigned per protocol performed.
4. Per YDR and DR administration, the responsibility to protocol CT exams with contrast is limited to radiology physicians and/or advanced practitioners, unless exam is eligible for autoprotocol. For exams ordered with IV contrast, the patient's eGFR should be â‰¥ 30. If the eGFR is < 30, should follow low eGFR workflow as follows:
   a. eGFR results for inpatient and ED patients should be within 48 hours. All inpatients and ED patients require a results value in order to proceed with contrast administration unless exam is eligible for eGFR bypass.
   b. Please note, any outpatient that answers "Yes" to a renal risk factor question on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire requires a renal function assessment. Those patients without risk factors do not require renal testing prior to receiving IV contrast. Patients will be given a Point of Care (POC) eGFR test to determine eGFR level if no eGFR value is available within 6 weeks in Epic. eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist.
5. All personnel involved in the administration of contrast media are responsible to be aware of the steps that can be taken to anticipate a contrast reaction in order to prevent it, or if one occurs, recognize it and take appropriate measures. See Addendum 1.15A Recognition and Response to Contrast Reaction.
6. eGFR Workflow and Responsibilities for CT
   a. If a CT study is ordered WITH contrast and eGFR is over 30, exam can be protocoled with IV contrast
   b. If a CT study is ordered with a Life/Limb Threatening priority, is a full trauma, or a stroke code, eGFR testing is not required prior to imaging
   c. If a CT study is ordered WITH contrast and eGFR is below 30 when patient arrives:
      i. Technologist will call the appropriate reading room to notify a radiologist. Radiologist then has to review the case and decide how to proceed as below:
7. Give contrast despite eGFR <30: A few studies have shown NO added risk of deterioration of renal function with IV contrast compared to matched controls regardless of renal function (2,3,5), however one study showed higher risk with eGFR <30 (1). If you have any doubt on the best choice, discuss with ordering provider and document reasoning in your report.
8. Change to CT WITHOUT contrast: If clinical question can be answered
   sufficiently without IV contrast, document the following in your dictation. Example, "Current study was initially ordered with IV contrast, however the patient's eGFR on 'date X' was 'X.' Thus, the exam was switched to without IV contrast to eliminate risk of renal injury."
   a. For Technologist: Place 52 Modifier on exam and e-mail 52Limited.Imaging@ynhh.org describing why the exam is being changed to without IV contrast.
   3. Exam should be canceled/rescheduled: If exam canceled, Clinical Scheduling Assistant (CSA) will note the cancel reason as "lab function out of range" in the order history in Epic.
      ii. Technologist should document in Epic study notes the name of radiologist who made the decision. If radiologist is ever unclear on what to do, they should discuss case with ordering provider.
      iii. If order is being CHANGED (to without contrast or canceled), then Technologist will communicate the radiologist's decision to CSA and ask CSA to contact the ordering physician's office.
         1. CSA, working from an approved script, will communicate the information to the ordering provider (or ordering provider's staff) including the eGFR value and the radiologist's recommendation for the patient's imaging.
            a. If the ordering provider does not agree with the radiologist's decision, CSA will connect provider to radiologist for discussion. CSA will wait for further direction from the radiologist and/or technologist once that call is completed.
            b. If the ordering provider agrees with the radiologist decision, the CSA will edit exam order with ordering provider using the following procedure:
               i. If changing to CT WITHOUT contrast:
               2. Epic Provider:
                  a. CSA will change the order in Epic to a noncontrast exam and send the order via Epic in-basket request for co-sign
                  b. CSA will track the order to ensure co-sign is received
               3. Non-Epic Provider:
                  a. CSA will change the order in Epic to a noncontrast exam
                  b. CSA will request a new requisition from the ordering physician
                  c. CSA will track to ensure the new requisition is received
                  d. CSA will upload the new requisition into the Media Manager section of Epic
                  e. Regardless of Epic or non-Epic provider, CSA will contact PFAS (PFASDrChanges@ynhh.org) to alert the pre-service team of the change in procedure code
                  f. Pre-service team will address any issues with authorization
                  g. CSA to track each order code via the change order excel
               ii. If cancelling the exam:
                  1. CSA will cancel the appointment in Epic and take direction from the ordering physician's office about reschedule
         c. If CSA cannot get in touch with ordering physician (or surrogate), the radiologist's decision will prevail. It is crucial that all our reports have documentation for reasoning to give or withhold contrast for this reason

# PROCEDURE GUIDELINES FOR INTRAVENOUS (IV) CONTRAST 

1. Intravenous contrast will be injected through an intravenous line previously established by the nurse or technologist. See DR Policy Medication Administration by Technologists in Diagnostic Radiology.
2. Prior to the administration of IV contrast, the patient's history including medications, allergies, and questions screening for renal impairment will be reviewed by the technologist in the patient's medical record, or obtained using the appropriate outpatient questionnaire, and subsequently scanned or entered into the medical record.
   a. If no contraindications to contrast are noted, the technologist proceeds with IV contrast administration as per protocol identified by the radiologist.
   b. If contraindications are noted, the case is referred to the radiologist for further consideration.
   c. An IV line will stay in place during the examination, should IV drug therapy be necessary.
   d. A physician, APP or RN must be on site during the contrast administration.
   e. A contrast reaction kit and emergency equipment (including a code cart if a hospital site) must be readily available.

## POINT OF CARE TESTING

1. Point of Care testing will be performed by the technologist/technologist aid or nursing as required for outpatients (and rarely for inpatients) at the time of the appointment. This test is inspected by the College of American Pathologists as part of the accreditation of the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Yale New Haven Hospital. The meter will diagnose the quantitative measurement of creatinine in capillary, venous, and arterial whole blood. eGFR may be calculated by meter or via EHR to evaluate renal function.
2. Point of Care meter will be maintained by the MRI and CT scan departments and a QA schedule will be strictly adhered to. Staff will be trained in the use of the meter during their orientation and reviewed for annual competency. Training will be performed by the Department of Laboratory Medicine.
3. Point of Care Renal Function Testing in Radiology
   a. MRI Patients
      i. Please see MRI safety manual for full details
   b. CT Patients
      i. Any outpatient that answers "Yes" to the contrast related questions on the CT Oral/IV Contrast Questionnaire will be given point of care testing to determine eGFR level if no eGFR/Cr value is available within 6 weeks.
      ii. eGFR levels under 30 are referred to the radiologist as detailed above.

# PRE-MEDICATION POLICY FOR PRIOR ALLERGIC LIKE REACTIONS TO CONTRAST MEDIA 

| For Planned Administration of Contrast Agents: |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Previous reaction to allergens (eg shellfish, peanuts, medications, etc): |  |  |
| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| None | None | None |

Previous reaction to same class of contrast agent going to be given:

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | Pre-medicate and use different agent | Do not give contrast* |

Previous reaction to a different class of Contrast agent than type to be given:

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | None | None |

*Unless in the opinion of the responsible health care professional and supervising radiologist, the potential benefits outweigh the risks i.e. emergency situations.
In these instances, clinical provider should accompany the patient to radiology suite (whenever feasible) to aid in management if a repeat reaction occurs.

Premedication with steroids and Benadryl is now recommended only for patients who have had a reaction to contrast of a similar class (iodinated agents used during CT are one class, gadolinium based agents used during MRI are separate class) to the one planned to be given. Prophylaxis for those with reactions to other allergens is no longer necessary.

This guideline has been drawn up based on the following information:

- Current estimated overall reaction risk in the general population of children and adults is less than $1 \%$ (in range of $0.2-0.6 \%$ ) (Wang et al., Dillman et al.)
- Patients with a prior reaction to the same class of contrast agent being administered are known to be at highest risk for repeat reaction, $3-11 \%$ overall reaction rate with $2 \%$ breakthrough reaction rate even with pre-medication during CT (Mervak et al. Lasser et al).
- The current standard of care in the United States is to pre-medicate patients with steroids and antihistamine to decrease risk of repeat contrast reaction in patients who have had a reaction in the past to a similar class contrast agent.
- An IV steroid regimen (Recommended regimen below) is likely non-inferior compared to a longer PO regimen and is therefore recommended in the ED and in-patient setting to expedite imaging when needed (Mervak et al)

# Exclusions 

- In certain clinical circumstances the urgency of a contrast enhanced CT or MRI may outweigh the benefits and time needed to complete approved premedication protocol, necessitating that contrast medium be given in absence of premedication or with a variation in the pretreatment protocol. This determination should be jointly agreed upon by supervising radiologist and ordering clinician and potentially the patient (if feasible) with documentation in medical record.


## Allergic Like Reaction Definitions ${ }^{1}$ :

| Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Limited urticaria ${ }^{2} /$ pruritis $^{2}$ | Diffuse urticaria / pruritis | Diffuse edema, or facial edema with dyspnea |
| Nasal congestion | Diffuse erythema, stable vital signs | Diffuse erythema with hypotension |
| Cutaneous Edema | Facial edema without dyspnea | Laryngeal edema with stridor and/or hypoxia |
| Sneezing / conjunctivitis / rhinorrhea | Throat tightness or hoarseness without dyspnea | Wheezing / bronchospasm, significant hypoxia |
| Limited "itchy"/"scratchy" throat | Wheezing / bronchospasm, mild or no hypoxia | Anaphylactic shock (hypotension + tachycardia) |

${ }^{1}$ Physiologic reactions like nausea, vomiting, feeling of warmth are unlikely to benefit from pre-medication
${ }^{2}$ If the urticaria/pruritis required medical treatment it should be considered moderate severity.
