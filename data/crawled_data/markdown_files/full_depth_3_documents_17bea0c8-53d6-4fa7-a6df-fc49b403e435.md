|  | Version 5 | RAD Mission: Faculty Development |
|  |  |  |
| Prepared By: Larry Saperstein MD and Rob Goodman MD |  | January 2023 |
| Approval: Rob Goodman, MD |  | January 2023 |

# Objectives 

Allocate appropriate TSL (triennial/sabbatical leave) to all full time (i.e., 100\% FTE) clinical faculty (Academic Clinician and Clinician Educator/Scholar tracks) at the Associate Professor and Full Professor rank to provide opportunities:

1. for professional growth and development so that they may serve more effectively in their field of specialization and/or in their academic pursuits and;
2. to step back from clinical duties in order to help restore/maintain energy, stamina and enthusiasm.

## TSL Application and Approval Process

1. Transparent and fair.
2. Supervised by the TSL Committee.
3. Faculty become eligible for TSL two years following promotion to Associate Professor.
4. Faculty are eligible 2.5 years from the January or July following the end of the previous TSL.
5. Eligible faculty will be notified in the fall of the year prior to the beginning of the academic year in which they will be eligible for TSL. In order to obtain Department and University approval, the completed application form must be submitted and approved by the TSL Committee and Departmental Chair before the beginning of December prior to the onset of the proposed TSL year.

## TSL Committee

1. The TSL Committee will be a standing committee in the Yale Department of Radiology \& Biomedical Imaging.
a. Members will be appointed by the Departmental Chair.
b. It will consist of a faculty member Chair and up to six additional faculty members representing assistant, associate and full professors within the department on both Academic Clinician and Clinician Educator/Scholar tracks.
c. There are no set term limits, but membership (including number of members) is subject to change at the discretion of the Departmental Chair.
d. The Committee will meet as often as necessary to fulfill the needs of the department and faculty.
2. The TSL Committee will review TSL applications for merit and benefits regarding individual career progression as well as benefits to the Department/School/Clinical Service. Eligible

faculty may have the option to provide a brief presentation of proposals to the TSL Committee.

# TSL Details 

1. Each eligible faculty member is invited to submit a robust leave plan.
2. The TSL committee will grade applications in order of merit. This grading would be based on individual career development potential and overall departmental benefit potential.
3. At least one Academic Clinician track and one Clinican Educator/Scholar track application will be approved.
4. The top 3 TSL applications ('formal TSL') will be selected and discussed with the relevant section chiefs/Chair for planning purposes.
5. The successful applicants will be informed that their submission is being considered and that the dates and duration being offered are being determined by the section chief and committee. The time awarded will be 2 months.
6. Once leave has been defined, the successful applicants will be informed that their requests were successful and that they are eligible to take a leave of absence for the specific time period in order to execute their proposal.
7. TSL will be treated like parental leave i.e. the schedule will be adjusted in order for the leave to be taken.
8. The successful formal TSL candidates will present the results/value of their leave to the TSL committee each year.
9. Formal TSL must be taken in uninterrupted 1 month blocks and the faculty member may not work clinically during this time, nor may they earn additional departmental dollars.
10. Parental leave of absence, as mandated by the University, will have priority over TSL.
11. Following approval, formal TSL may be limited, changed, postponed, or canceled before or after it commences based on departmental and sectional clinical needs. Although the department will strive to accommodate all appropriate requests, everyone may not receive the same amount of formal TSL.
12. TSL will normally be granted for those faculty in phased retirement.
13. Each of the other approved requests will be allocated 2 weeks of TSL time over the academic year. This will be termed 'eligible TSL'. This time can be used at the requestor's discretion and can be worked through, added to PTO time to provide a longer block or can be used as leave spread over the academic year. The days cannot be carried over.

## Deliverables

1. Within one year of completion of a formal TSL, the faculty member will provide a one page summary to the TSL Committee that delineates how they used their TSL to meet the approved plan for their leave of absence.
2. Faculty may be requested to meet with the TSL Committee (and possibly other invitees) to describe how their formal TSL helped them meet their approved leave of absence plan.

## FAQs

Q. What does the faculty handbook say about TSL?
A. University guidance states the following:

- It is a privilege and not a right.

- For accounting purposes, TSL must be taken in the period for which it is approved (Jan thru June for Jan 1st eligibility, July thru June - for July $1^{\text {st }}$ eligibility).
- If the applicant takes only a portion of the formal TSL during the academic year awarded, the remaining time may not roll over into subsequent years.
- No faculty member may have more than 6 months leave of absence (in any combination of leaves) in any 18 month period.
Q. What factors will be considered in the TSL approval process?
A. For formal TSL awards, the TSL Committee will take into account the following:
- Purpose and merits of the submitted leave of absence plan.
- Time needed to execute the plan.
- Time since previous TSL.
- Other TSLs granted in the past within the applicant's clinical section/division.
Q. If there are competing formal TSL requests within a section, what factors will/will not be used to prioritize?
- Priority
- Quality of application
- Time since last TSL
- Number of previous TSLs awarded to that section/division
- No Priority
- Leadership role (e.g., Vice Chairs vs others)
- Rank (Professor vs Assoc Professor)
- Track (Clinical vs CE/CS)
Q. Can I augment my income during my formal TSL?
A. During your formal TSL, no additional income may be derived from clinical work related to radiology either within or outside the Department. This includes deriving moonlighting/daylighting for the department, paid call, teleradiology, or locum tenens.
Q. Does this mean that I could have decreased net income during my formal TSL?
A. If you augment your income with other departmental activities, you will not be able to earn this additional income during your TSL. However, you will still be eligible for your full Clinical Productivity Bonus (Academic Clinician track) or Academic Productivity Bonus (Clinician Educator/Scholar track), regardless of the length of your approved TSL.
Q. If I am on the Clinician Educator/Scholar track, how will TSL and the output from my TSL affect my Academic Productivity Bonus?
A. Clinician Educator/Scholar track faculty are eligible for the full Academic Productivity Bonus (i.e., no change in criteria or amount due to TSL). Failure to use your TSL to achieve your approved goals will not have a negative impact on your Academic Productivity Bonus. However, if you use your TSL to augment your academic output, you may be eligible for earlier promotion and for a higher bonus level according to existing departmental bonus guidelines.
Q. What will the consequences be if I fail to successfully complete my approved formal TSL plan?

A. If, after careful consideration, including an in-person meeting, the TSL Committee determines that your TSL was not appropriately used to achieve the approved objectives, the Committee may recommend that your next available TSL receive a lower priority or, in extreme circumstances, be denied.
Q. How does a formal TSL affect my clinical target, CME time, vacation time, and supplemental income?
A. Your clinical target, academic time, paid time off (PTO: includes vacation and CME), and administrative time will be prorated based on the TSL time granted. Faculty who take block TSL will be eligible for Y-payments if they are required to work above their reduced target during the remainder of the year.
Q. What happens if I am asked to work during my formal TSL by the Department?
A. If you are required to work during your formal TSL, the TSL will be deemed to have been cancelled, and your application will be deferred to the following year. If you are asked to work a portion of your formal TSL, the leave will be deemed to have been reduced, but will not carry over.
Q. How will this work if I already have approved days off of clinical service for other activities (e.g., section chief, residency activities, etc)?
A. If you usually work 120 clinical days/year and you are approved for a two month TSL, you would be expected to work 100 clinical days during that year.
Q. Can I take parental leave and TSL in the same academic year?
A. Every effort will be made to ensure that time off of clinical service is distributed fairly and equitably and does not place an excessive burden on other members of your section. Taking parental leave and TSL in the same academic year will be discouraged and may influence the priority that your TSL receives by the TSL Committee and section chiefs. Your TSL may be reduced or deferred accordingly, and faculty members may not have more than 6 months leave of absence (i.e., any combination of TSL and paternity leave) in any 18 month period.
Q. Are Vice Chairs eligible for TSL?
A. Yes. Their applications will be assessed by the TSL Committee in the usual manner.
