# 1.0 Purpose 

This SOP is intended to define how grant funded research \% effort is applied to clinical effort for clinician scientists who are on the CES track.

## Scope

Faculty may be awarded research \% effort as part of individual or collaborative grant awards. This research effort may be used to reduce clinical \% effort. Clinical faculty on scholarly tracks already receive dedicated academic time but may need increased academic time due to funding success. This SOP applies to both selfinitiated and industry grants and is beyond the prescriptive level provided by training grants (e.g., NIH K-award, Doris Duke Charitable Funding, YCCI etc.) to which the award rules will apply.

## Materials

None

## 4.0 Procedures:

4.1 If a faculty member secures grant funding \% effort, this may be used in conjunction with departmentally funded \% non-clinical effort.
4.2 CES Track with grant funded research:

Any grant funded \% effort above $10 \%$ will be applied towards a reduction in clinical \% effort. Due to the need for a minimum level of clinical activity, no faculty member on the CES track, will be able to have less than $50 \%$ clinical effort.

4.2.1 For example,

- If a CES track faculty member (with 20\% departmentally funded nonclinical effort) receives 10\% research effort, their clinical \% effort will be unchanged.
- If a CES track faculty member (with 20\% departmentally funded nonclinical effort) receives $15 \%$ research effort, their clinical effort will be reduced by an additional $5 \%$.
4.2.2 Multiple small grants held by a single faculty member may be additive.
- Example: Five 3\% grants may be equivalent to a single 15\% grant. Their clinical effort would be reduced by $5 \%$.

4.3 CES Track with independent PI grant funded research:

Any grant funded \% effort will be applied towards a reduction in clinical \% effort in addition to the Departmental 20\% non-clinical effort. Due to the need for a minimum level of clinical activity, no faculty member on the CES/CS track with nontraining grant funding, should have less than 50\% clinical effort.
4.3.1 For example,

- If a CES track faculty member (with 20\% departmentally funded nonclinical effort) receives $10 \%$ research effort as a PI from an RO1, their clinical \%effort will be reduced by an additional 10\%.
4.3.2 Multiple small grants held by a single faculty member may be additive.
- Example: (5) 3\% grants may be equivalent to a single 15\% grant. Their clinical effort will be reduced by an additional 15\%.
