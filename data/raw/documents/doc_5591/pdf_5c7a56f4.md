# A. Purpose 

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the Department of Radiology's policy for jury duty.

## B. Scope

The SOP applies to all YDR clinical faculty. Under CT law, the employer is obligated to pay for up to 5 days of lost work for a full-time employee.

## C. Procedures

1. YDR clinical faculty
a. Day 1: Scheduled as an academic day (often cancelled).

Day 2-5: Clinical or academic days with no penalty.
Day 6+: Counted as PTO or lost money at the end of the year (one can get reimbursed $\$ 50 /$ day by the court at this point).
b. In regard to Days 2-5, use of clinical vs. academic time depends on the schedule in place. For example, if a faculty member is called to serve for 5 days and usually receives 1 academic day/week, jury duty time would include 4 clinical days and 1 academic day.
