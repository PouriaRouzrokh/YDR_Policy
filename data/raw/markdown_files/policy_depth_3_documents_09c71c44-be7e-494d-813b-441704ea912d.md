Magnetic Resonance Imaging is an ever changing, evolving technology. There are potential risks in the MR environment, not only for the patient but also for the accompanying family members, attending health care professionals and others who find themselves only occasionally or rarely in the magnetic fields of MR scanners, such as security, housekeeping personnel, firefighters, police, etc. This manual has been developed to help guide the MR staff regarding these issues.

The policies written in this manual are guidelines to follow as a standard of care throughout the Yale New Haven Health system MRI departments. It is at the discretion of the supervising radiology attending to divert from any policy in an emergency situation. Please refer to page 101 "Exceptions of MR safety policies" for further detail.

It is the intent of the Yale New Haven Hospital safety manual to:

- Protect and educate all patients, direct and ancillary personal about the possible risks, associated with the MR Suite including but not limited to static, time-varying magnetic fields and RF pulses.
- To be in compliance with the most up to date MR safety information provided by the Joint Commission and the ACR
- Prove helpful as the field of MRI continues to evolve and mature, providing MR services that are among the most powerful, yet safest, of all diagnostic procedures to be developed in the history of modern medicine.

1.All clinical and research MR sites, irrespective of magnet format or field strength, including installations for diagnostic, research, interventional, and/or surgical applications, should maintain MR safety policies
2. These policies and procedures will be regularly reviewed by the MR Safety Officer and the Medical Director to account for the significant changes in the MR center environment. This will take into account ACR, Joint Commission and international standards.
3. The responsibility for implementation and maintenance of these policies and procedures belong to the Medical Director of the YNHH MRI Centers.
4. Annually, all MR personnel will review safety within the MR environment
5. Provide all non-MR staff, patients and their families with appropriate materials (e.g., guidelines, brochure, and poster) that explain the potential for accidents and adverse events in the MRI environment.
6. Provide Access to all updated safety policies to all MR staff online and/or an updated hard copy in every MR area.
7. MR safety incidents or "near incidents" that occur in the MRI center are to be reported to the Manager of the center, the MR safety officer, and the Medical Director in a timely manner, an Event Report (RL solutions) should be documented by the technologist via the intranet and to the FDA Maude website if any equipment was involved www.fda.gov/medwatch.

The MR task group of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International has developed a set of MR safety terms. This terminology is NOT being applied retrospectively to implants and devices that previously received FDA approved labeling using the terms "MR safe" or "MR compatible". This applies to those objects tested prior to December 2005.

Particularly with regard to nonclinical and incidental equipment, current products marketed with ill-defined terminology such as "nonmagnetic", or the outdated classifications described above ("MR compatible"), should NOT be presumed to conform to a particular current ASTM classification.

To go along with the new terminology, the ASTM introduced corresponding icons consistent with international standards for colors and shapes of safety signs. They are intended for use on items that may be brought into or near the MRI environment as well as in product labeling.

- MR SAFE - is an item that poses no known hazards in all MRI environments. Using the new terminology, "MR Safe" items include non-conducting, nonmetallic, non-magnetic items such as a plastic Petri dish. The "MR Safe" icon consists of the of the letters "MR" in green in a white square with a green border or - the letters "MR" in white in a green square.
- MR CONDITIONAL - is an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a specified MR environment as long as specified conditions of use are met. The "MR Conditional" icon consists of the letter "MR" in black inside a yellow triangle with a black border. The item labeling must include the results of testing and the specific conditions of use sufficient to characterize the behavior of the item in the MRI environment.
- MR UNSAFE - is an item that is known to pose hazards in all MRI environments. MR Unsafe items include magnetic items such as a pair of ferromagnetic scissors. The "MR Unsafe" icon consists of the letters "MR" in black in a white field inside a red circle with a diagonal red band.
- Safety in MRI Not Evaluated- For devices that have historically not provided any information about MRI safety

The ACR established the 4 zone concept as defined in the ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices: 2007. The four zone concept provides for progressive restrictions in access to the MRI scanner. All MRI Suites are marked with Zone signs

- Zone I: General public freely accessible to the public. This area is typically outside the MR environment.
- Zone II: Limited Access: This is the Zone located between the public uncontrolled Zone 1 and the strictly controlled Zone 3. This area has limited access - available to patients, family members and hospital personnel who have been safety trained or safety screened by Level 2 MR personnel. It is in Zone II that the answers to MR screening questions, patient histories, medical insurance questions, etc. are typically obtained.

![img-1.jpeg](images/img-1.jpeg.png)

- Zone III: The MR scanner (Zone 4) itself is located adjacent to this space. Zone III can be defined as regions from which potentially hazardous energies (related to the MR imaging process) may be accessed. Zone III regions should be physically restricted from general public access by, for example, key locks, passkey locking systems, or any other reliable, physically restricting method. Only MR personnel shall be provided free access, such as the access keys or passkeys, to Zone III. Patients, family members, or hospital staff that has undergone safety screening or safety training will be allowed access to this area only when accompanied by appropriate MR personnel.
- Zone IV: Is the room housing the MR scanner itself. Zone IV should also be demarcated and clearly marked as being potentially hazardous due to the presence of very strong magnetic fields. Zone IV, by definition, will always be located within Zone III as it is the MR magnet and its associated magnetic field which generates the existence of Zone III. Only patients and family members, or hospital staff accompanied by Level 2 MR personnel who have undergone safety screening or safety training will be admitted to this Zone.

![img-2.jpeg](images/img-2.jpeg.png)

Non-MR Personnel should be accompanied by, or under the immediate supervision of and visual contact with, one specifically identified MR person for the entirety of their duration within Zone III and a level 2 MR person in Zone IV restricted regions.

# SITE ACCESS RESTRICTIONS: 

## MRI Center, Fitkin Basement

The MRI outpatient center is located at 789 Howard Avenue. Stretcher/wheelchair bound patients will be transferred to MR safe equipment in the prep hold area located adjacent to MR 5 and MR 1. The amount of additional hospital staff for any procedural MRI's will be restricted to 3 people per service; this will help alleviate overcrowding and potential safety incidents.

# Smilow (Level 2), MRI Suite 

The Smilow MRI Suite is located at 20 Park Street, second floor of the Smilow Cancer Hospital. Stretcher and wheelchair bound patients will be transferred to MR safe equipment in the prep hold area.
