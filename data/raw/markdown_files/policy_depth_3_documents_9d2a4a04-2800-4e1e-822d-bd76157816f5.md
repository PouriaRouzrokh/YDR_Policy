# 1.0 Purpose 

This SOP is intended to define how grant funded research % effort is applied to clinical effort for faculty on C-track.

### 2.0 Scope

C-track faculty may be awarded research % effort as part of individual or collaborative grant awards. This research effort may be used to reduce clinical % effort. This SOP applies to both self-initiated and industry grants.

### 3.0 Materials

None

### 4.0 Procedures:

4.1 If a faculty member secures grant funding % effort, this will be used in conjunction with departmentally funded % non-clinical effort.

4.2 C Track:

Any % effort beyond $2.5 \%$ will be applied towards a reduction in clinical % effort.

4.2.1 For example,

- If a C track faculty member (with 5% departmentally funded non-clinical effort) receives $2 \%$ research effort, their clinical % effort will be unchanged.

- If a C track faculty member (with 5% departmentally funded non-clinical effort) receives $3 \%$ research effort, their clinical effort will be reduced by $0.5 \%$.

4.3 The first $2.5 \%$ will go to YDR to offset existing non-clinical department support.
