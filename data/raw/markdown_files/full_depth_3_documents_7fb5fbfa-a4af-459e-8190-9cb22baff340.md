# A. Purpose 

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the Department of Radiology's process for inclement weather and other unforeseen operational circumstances requiring radiology services to be suspended. In these instances, our top priority is to continue to provide excellent and accessible patient care while maintaining the safety of our radiologists.

## B. Scope

a. The SOP applies to YNHH and BH radiology inpatient and outpatient sites.
b. There will inevitably be occasions when clinical operations are curtailed due to unforeseen circumstances, such as snowstorms, hurricanes and other unpredictable events. During these times, clinical radiology activity will be reduced.

## C. Procedures

a. The VC for Clinical Affairs will communicate $\mathrm{YNHH} / \mathrm{BH}$ operational changes to faculty and trainees.
b. Faculty should be flexible depending on conditions. The goal is to staff to demand.
c. An appropriate number of faculty should work from home whenever possible.
d. Expected coverage and appropriate staffing is the responsibility of the division/section chiefs, depending on the situation and expected reduced caseload. Minimal staffing guidelines may revert to a weekend staffing model or other curtailed staffing model.

Guide to Minimum Coverage, if a weekend staffing model is not used*

| Division/Section | \# Faculty* | Comments |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Body | 3 | Need someone at SRC to cover fluoro, <br> can be covered by fellow |

| * If additional staffing is required, it should be approved by the Chair or VC Clinical Affairs <br> ** All faculty should be WFH whenever possible, as determined by their Division/Section Chief |  |  |
| e. Radiologist staffing should mirror closures of staffed outpatient facilities i.e. if an <br> ambulatory center is closed, the radiologist scheduled for that site would no longer be <br> required. In the unusual situation where an outpatient site is maintained open, appropriate <br> remote and/or on-site staffing should be arranged in addition to the above. Note that there <br> may be outpatient procedures at YNHH, SRC and SMC, although usually limited. |  |  |
| f. Decisions as to whether radiologists are required in-house will be made by the Section <br> Chief. This decision may be based on safety (distance needed to travel/type of car) and <br> those most willing to work. On occasion, the person listed on-call may be responsible for <br> in-house coverage. |  |  |
| g. Faculty not working on those days will be deemed to be on an academic day. They will not <br> lose claim to PTO due to this mandated absence from the clinical schedule. If necessary, <br> a "snow day make up slot" may be added to the clinical schedule if approved by the Chair <br> or VC for Clinical Affairs. |  |  |
| h. Resident coverage needed will be decided by the Section Chiefs. Which residents come in <br> should be determined by the Chief Residents. For the residents who do not come in, that <br> day will not be counted as a vacation day. |  |  |
| i. Multi-day storms and other rare scenarios may require coverage adjustment. <br> j. If a storm is less severe than predicted, faculty may be required to come in despite an <br> earlier cancellation of services. |  |  |
| k. YNHH may provide in-house boarding for faculty who need to stay overnight. If faculty <br> need to book lodging elsewhere, s/he should get prior approval by YDR administration <br> and use hotels offering Yale discounts. |  |  |
