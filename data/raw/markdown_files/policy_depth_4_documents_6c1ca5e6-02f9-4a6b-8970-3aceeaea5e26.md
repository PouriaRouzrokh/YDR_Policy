## PURPOSE

To provide guidance for inpatients to safely self-manage their own care Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pump (CSII or Insulin Pump) and/or Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems.

## APPLICABILITY

This policy applies to each licensed hospital affiliated with Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), including Bridgeport Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, Westerly Hospital, Yale New Haven Hospital and any other hospital that may affiliate with YNHHS.

## DEFINITIONS

CSII / Insulin pump: An external continuous infusion device used to deliver a constant infusion of rapid-acting insulin (pre-set basal insulin rates) and patient-delivered pre-meal boluses and correction boluses of insulin to manage glycemic control.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems use a small "sensor" inserted subcutaneously to continuously measure glucose levels in interstitial fluid. Results from the sensor are transmitted to a "receiver" device (which at times can be a smart phone), which displays real-time glucose levels and glycemic trends.

Automated Insulin Delivery Insulin Pump system is interfaced with CGM, which alters basal insulin delivery in response to trajectories and absolute concentrations of interstitial glucose. Importantly, patients will still need to bolus for carbohydrate intake and may need to administer correction doses of insulin.

- Low suspend and predictive low glucose suspend systems (examples include the t:slim **X 2**™ with Basal-IQ **™**, Medtronic 530G, Medtronic 630G): Interrupt basal insulin delivery either in response to a low sensor glucose value or a predicted low sensor glucose value.
- Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) insulin pumps (examples include Medtronic 670G and the t:sim X2 **™** with Control-IQ **™** ): Systems with the capacity to both increase or reduce basal insulin delivery based on sensor glucose values.

# POLICY 

A. The admitting provider evaluates if the patient or identified caregiver (significant other (SO), parent, guardian) is capable of self-management of the insulin pump and/or CGM system.

B. The patient's insulin pump settings (i.e., basal-bolus settings) may require adjustment during hospitalization to prevent, or at least minimize, hyper- and hypoglycemia, including but not limited to:

   a. Stress of illness, infection, surgery

   b. Alterations in carbohydrate intake

   c. Enteral or parenteral nutrition

   d. Administration of medications that may alter glycemic control (e.g., steroids, pressors, octreotide, etc.)

C. Adjustments to the insulin pump settings are ordered by the provider.

D. The patient maintains and adjusts the settings for his/her insulin pump per provider order.

E. If surgery is planned, the anesthesiologist and the patient will collaborate on the use of the insulin pump and/or CGM in the perioperative period.

F. CGM is not FDA-approved to guide inpatient hospital therapy. However, CGM is sometimes paired to the insulin pump, and therefore may be useful in informing self-care.

## PROCEDURE

### Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII / Insulin) Pump

1. The provider will verify that the patient wishes to maintain control of their medical condition by continuing on his/her insulin pump during the hospital stay and is able to participate in self-care.

2. The provider will confirm the patient's (or caregiver's) ability to manage the insulin pump including:

   a. Fully alert and oriented to person, place and time

   b. Manual dexterity to manage insulin pump and infusion set changes

   c. Visual acuity sufficient to properly read the pump screens and device buttons

   d. Ready access to patient's insulin pump supplies, provided by the patient or family/SO from home

   e. A signed agreement from the patient for insulin pump management during admission. The signed form is to be placed in the patient's medical record and a copy given to the patient.

3. The provider will assess for potential contraindications to insulin pump management including:

   a. Patient unable to manage insulin pump due to change in cognition, impaired level of consciousness, manual dexterity or visual limitations.

   b. Behavioral/self-harm concerns (not an absolute contraindication; psychiatrist to determine)

   c. Major psychiatric disturbance (not an absolute contraindication; provider to determine)

   d. Lack of patient-provided insulin pump supplies

   e. Medical conditions, such as DKA, critical illness

   f. Insulin pump malfunction

   g. Other reasons as determined by provider

4. The provider will explain to the patient that the health care team reserves the right to remove the pump from the patient at any time during their stay if it is assessed that the patient is no longer able to manage his/her own care.

5. The provider will make an alternative insulin replacement plan (Basal-Bolus-Correction insulin regimen or insulin infusion order) and allow removal of the insulin pump from the patient in the event the insulin pump is discontinued

6. Nurse to confirm patient-supplied insulin pump supplies are available to support pump use throughout the hospital stay as the hospital does NOT stock these supplies for insulin pumps. There should be enough supplies for scheduled changes and at least one unscheduled site change. These are to be kept at the patient's bedside.

7. Pharmacist to confirm patient-supplied insulin vial(s) as outlined in the YNHHS Medications Brought into the Organization by Patients or their Families Policy. If patient-supplied insulin is not available, provider can order a vial to be supplied by the Pharmacy.

8. Nursing will verify that a provider order exists in the patient's medical record for use of insulin pump in the hospital setting. The order must contain the following:

   a. To leave insulin pump in place and continue current basal rates and other settings

   b. Contact information including phone number/pager number of the Clinician who prescribed/manages the insulin pump with the patient

   c. Manufacturer of insulin pump

   d. Generic and Brand name of insulin used in the pump as well as concentration

   e. Basal rate settings including hourly doses with start and stop time.

   f. Bolus dose parameters for mealtime and correction insulin for off-target glucose readings

   g. For hybrid closed-loop insulin pump systems only, an indication that the insulin pump is capable of "automated delivery mode" for basal insulin alterations and/or auto-boluses

   h. Target blood glucose ranges

   i. Hospital POC glucose testing with associated Hypoglycemia Management orders

   j. Infusion site change at least every 72 hours

      i. Infusion site may be changed sooner if inflammation, tenderness, redness, swelling, bleeding of site or blood glucose results greater than $250 mg/dL for 2 consecutive readings at least 2 hours apart

      ii. Point of care blood glucose testing one hour after infusion site change to assess insulin delivery/absorption

   k. Removal of insulin pump before radiological procedures unless the device manufacturer provides information supporting safe use. If the device cannot be temporarily stopped, see the Appendix for additional information for evaluation of risks and benefits.

10. Nurse will document the presence of the insulin pump as well as the date of the last infusion set and site change on admission.

11. Nurse will communicate to the patient the POC glucose each time it's performed. Nurse will document in the MAR all patient-administered mealtime bolus and correction doses in real time, which will include the time of administration and the units of insulin given.

12. Nurse will assess and document the location and appearance of the infusion site for signs of inflammation or infection once a shift.

13. Nurse will notify the provider if:

   a. Blood glucose targets are not consistently maintained

   b. Any concerns with patient's ability to self-manage their insulin pump

   c. Patient is unable to change infusion set due to lack of supplies or otherwise unable

      i. For imaging time less than an hour, the insulin pump may be temporarily disconnected from the patient with no alternate insulin therapy provided

      ii. For imaging time greater than an hour the provider should consider ordering an alternate form of insulin therapy

   b. The insulin pump must be kept outside of the room where the diagnostic imaging procedure is being performed

   c. Infusion sets that contain a metal cannula must be removed by the patient prior to MRI

15. If insulin pump is discontinued due to patient inability to self-manage or other critical medical condition the following must occur:

   a. Alternate insulin therapy must be immediately ordered (SC or infusion) and initiated

   b. Insulin pump must be disconnected from the patient

   c. Insulin pump will be either secured by staff per individual facility policy or sent home with a designated family member/SO

# APPENDIX: 

The insulin pump or CGM system are to be removed before any radiological procedure involving xray/fluoroscopy, CT scanning or MRI unless the device manufacturer provides information supporting safe use. If the device cannot be temporarily stopped, see the below for additional information for evaluation of risks and benefits.

## Insulin Pump and CGM Systems during X-ray exams, CT Scans and MRI

- The presence of an insulin pump or glucose monitor should not preclude medically indicated CT or X-ray imaging but device should be removed whenever possible.
- The probability that x-ray or CT scan irradiation causes a device malfunction and an adverse event is extremely low and even less if the device is not in the region that is being imaged.
- No known adverse events during CT imaging of insulin pumps or glucose monitors are reported. Other electronic devices such as cardiac implantable electronic devices and neurostimulators have reported possible adverse events but there is little evidence that CT irradiation was the direct cause of these events.
