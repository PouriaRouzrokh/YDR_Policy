## Office of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion

Copy Link

Yale School of Medicine seeks to build and sustain a diverse community empowered to transform health care and biomedical science.

Through the Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion's education and training, learners, faculty, and staff will recognize and be able to contribute to Yale's equity efforts and address the systemic barriers to health care that the most vulnerable encounter.

We envision an inclusive community where everyone's voice and contribution are valued and respected. Through specific programs and initiatives, we aim to create a sense of belonging for all.

## Discrimination & Harassment Resource Coordinators

Copy Link

Yale is a community committed to fostering an environment of diversity, mutual respect, and intellectual discovery in which all students can thrive. Acts of discrimination and harassment are contrary to the community standards and ideals of our university. Yale does not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, disability, or veteran status. If you have experienced discrimination or harassment, been witness to a situation, or just need to talk, we encourage you to seek support. When you have concerns or questions, you have a wide range of choices for support.

You can reach out to a Discrimination and Harassment Resource Coordinator (DHRC) or can talk with others, such as the Dean of Student Affairs or the Office of Institutional Equity and Accessibility. DHRCs receive concerns and offer advice and guidance related to diversity and inclusion, discrimination and harassment, retaliation, and equal opportunity.
