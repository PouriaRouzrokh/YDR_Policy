# Safety & Security Resources

Yale is located in the heart of a vibrant urban community, with all the arts, culture, and rich diversity of experience that city life brings. With city living, it is important to take steps to stay safe, and Yale invests in significant public safety resources.

Yale Security and the Yale Police Department keep students and other community members safe. Yale has over 500 [Blue Phones](https://your.yale.edu/community/public-safety) scattered around campus, and students, faculty, and staff can also use the [LiveSafe](https://your.yale.edu/community/public-safety/stay-safe-campus/livesafe-app) app to turn their own cellular devices into a safety device.

Yale School of Medicine's (YSM) Safety & Security Committee meets every other month and creates a dedicated forum for addressing safety and security concerns impacting the YSM community. This page provides information about how to share any safety/security concerns or ideas with the committee, as well as past meeting minutes, upcoming meeting dates, and a list of committee members.

LiveSafe App
