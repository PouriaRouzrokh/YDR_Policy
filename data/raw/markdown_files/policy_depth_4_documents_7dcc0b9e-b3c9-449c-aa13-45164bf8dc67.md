# Lead aprons no longer needed for patients during X-ray exams

Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS) has implemented a new practice in which lead aprons are no longer used on patients undergoing routine X-ray exams. This change is based on confidence in safety protocols and aligns with the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle. X-ray technologists will use the lowest amount of radiation necessary to produce quality images.

If you have any questions, please speak with your X-ray technologist.
