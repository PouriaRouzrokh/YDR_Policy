# A. Purpose 

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe the YDR policy regarding faculty time off for bereavement. Faculty allowed time to grieve during the immediate period at the time of death of a family member.

## B. Scope

The SOP applies to all clinical faculty.

## C. Procedures

1. Up to three bereavement days will be given to faculty for death of immediate family (parent, parent-in-law, brother, sister, spouse, child, grandparent, domestic partner, grandchild) without loss of pay.
a. Please contact your section chief that you will be absent. S/he will inform Serena DelBasso and/or Goodman and Hooley.
b. Bereavement days may be taken from clinical days and academic days, as per the existing schedule.
2. While up to three days are allowed, under certain circumstances the section chief may have the discretion to allow additional time away. Any additional time should count towards standard personal time off (e.g. PTO). If additional time is needed, one may apply for a formal University leave of absence (LOA), under the guidance of YDR HR/Marla Pella.
3. If the faculty member is away on vacation at the time of death of the immediate family member, the bereavement days may replace vacation days.
4. Bereavement days should be taken during the initial week of loss and one's clinical target will be reduced accordingly.
