| Title: Converting Admin Stipends Into Time | SOP 015.00 | Effective Date: <br> February 2022 |
|  | Version 2 | YDR Clinical / <br> Education/ |

# A. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure is to provide guidance to faculty members who convert administrative stipends into time off the clinical service as it relates to their expected clinical day commitment each year. The expected clinical days are based on the ladder track but may vary based on administrative responsibilities, funded research, LOA and/or part-time status. Each year the number of expected clinical days are set for each faculty member and this information is used by the department leadership to appropriately staff clinical services.

1. The replacement cost of clinical shifts is high given that full-time faculty have considerable embedded fixed costs. Replacement costs are not solely covered by the departmental daily rate.

## B. Scope

The document will outline the process that will need to be followed to make a request to relinquish clinical service days related to clinical targets each academic year.

## C. Procedure

Faculty who wish to use administrative stipends to relinquish time off the clinical service, and thus reduce their clinical targets will need to discuss this request with YDR leadership. Keep in mind that requests will be evaluated equally and that there is also no guarantee that your request will be approved. Requests to convert small administrative stipends to time are not encouraged, since such administrative work is often managed during the standard clinical day.

1. The cost of relinquishing time off the clinical schedule will be at the rate of $2000 per day.
2. Faculty whose administrative stipends are used to relinquish time off the clinical service understand that these must be used for academic/administrative work.
3. These days may be labelled as academic on the clinical schedule. These are not PTO days.
4. If a faculty member reduces their clinical target, but finishes the year above their reduced target, they will be reimbursed in July at the initial higher rate.
