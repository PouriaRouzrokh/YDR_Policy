## - THE UNIVERSITY'S PREFERRED TRAVEL SUPPLIER IS WORLD TRAVEL.

## Submission of receipts should occur in a timely manner (within 10 days of incurring the expense or returning from travel - for travel greater than 30 days, consult with the business office)

## Air/Rail/Ground Transportation

- Travelers are expected to book Economy class airfare for domestic flights.
- Travelers are expected to fly Economy class for all flights except:
- Travelers may fly lowest available Business class for travel if the business office confirms before purchase that appropriate funds are available, and at least one of the following conditions is met:
  - Any flight segment that has a scheduled in-air flying time in excess of five hours, OR
  - The total scheduled in-air flight time, including connecting legs, is in excess of eight hours, OR
  - A medical justification documented by a primary care provider.
- Business class cannot be charged to federally sponsored awards however the economy class portion of the flight can be and the delta to non-sponsored.
- Airfare on federally funded awards: travel must be booked on an American Flag Carrier unless the flight(s) qualify for an exception under the Open Skies Act. Travelers using Department of Defense (DoD) funds are not permitted to take advantage of Open Sky Agreements; however, other exceptions may apply. The business office must approve any exceptions before the airfare is booked. Please check with the business office if you need assistance.
- Travelers (or their designees) on federally sponsored awards are expected to document their selection of economy unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements, by including an airfare comparison from a travel service (e.g., Sanditz, Travelocity, Orbitz, Expedia) contemporaneous with the booking.
- At least 3 comparison flights (if available) are needed to fulfill this requirement only if booking outside of World Travel
- University defines "unrestricted accommodations" as including all three of the following: Seat selection, checked luggage, refundable fare. We do not want any flights being booked that are not refundable.
- Students must always travel Economy class regardless of the length of flight.
- Missed flights, double booking, flight changes or additional costs resulting in penalties caused by the traveler are the responsibility of the traveler, i.e. it is a personal expense and University funds may not be used to cover the additional costs.

EXCEPTIONS will be made when a penalty is unavoidable due to business reasons or circumstances beyond the traveler's control, e.g. scheduling conflict for work, weather conditions.

- Traveler's insurance, flight upgrades, or additional costs resulting in upgrades caused by the traveler are the responsibility of the traveler.
- Fees for snacks and non-alcoholic beverages are reimbursable.
- If snacks and non-alcoholic drinks are submitted for reimbursement, the traveler must use actual costs for meals versus the per diem for the entire trip.
- Wi-Fi, preferred seating and extra leg room are reimbursable but may not be charged to a federally sponsored award thus the costs for these add-ons need to be split out from airline ticket price.
- Business class service is allowed for reimbursement on Amtrak and Acela (NOT First-class service)
- The shuttle service should be used when travelling between the University campuses (25 Science Park, West Campus, Medical School Campus, and Central Campus).

# FY-25 Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging Travel & Keimbursement 

- Use of personal points/mileage for purchase of airfare will not be reimbursed.
- Personal Mileage reimbursement is 67 cents per mile effective 01/01/24; this is subject to change. Refer to the Controller's Office Fact Sheet for the current rate (https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/guides/controllers-office-factsheet).
- If travelers use their personal vehicle for business travel, documentation of business miles must include the business purpose for the travel and the number of miles driven. Note: personal vehicle reimbursement is limited to no more than the cost of a comparable trip's air travel within economy unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements.
- If a personal vehicle is used for business purposes primarily for the traveler's convenience and results in a higher cost than other modes of transportation, reimbursement will be limited to the lower of the following:
  - cost of the air travel within economy unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements, between the nearest commercial airport serving the origin and destination cities.
  - or cost of train fare within the main cabin class (e.g., economy, coach) that is reasonably priced, consistent with business requirements, between the nearest passenger station serving the origin and destination cities.
- The University assumes no liability for any loss or damage to the employee's vehicle. If an accident occurs when a traveler is using a personal vehicle for business travel, the employee's personal automobile liability and physical damage insurance is primary.
- If your business travel is extended to include personal travel, you must provide a flight/train comparison to show that the additional days do not result in increased costs. This should be done at the time the actual flight/train is booked. If the cost is more expensive for a longer stay, you must reimburse Yale for the difference.
- International travel: You are allowed to arrive one day before the conference starts and should depart no later than the day after the conference ends. This means in certain instances you may depart more than one day prior to conference start date to allow for arrival the day before the conference begins.
- Domestic travel: You are allowed to arrive one day before the conference starts and should depart no later than the day after the conference ends.

## Car Rental

- The University has negotiated discounts with preferred rental car agencies. These discounts are available through Yale's preferred travel supplier using their online or full-service travel agency services. Travelers should rent the most economical (compact or midsize) vehicle consistent with business needs and travel circumstances. To take advantage of any University-negotiated discounts, travelers must make reservations using the University's preferred full-service travel agency.
- We will only reimburse for compact/midsize rental - price comparison at the time of booking will need to be provided if there is no business need or extenuating circumstance for an upgrade.
- Charges for satellite radio will not be reimbursed.
- Domestic Car Rental from preferred vendors:
  - Do NOT purchase insurance coverage of any kind when renting from a preferred vendor within the contiguous 48 states. Insurance is automatically included with rentals from preferred vendors within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia
  - Travelers should decline any additional insurance coverage offered by car rental companies. It duplicates insurance already provided by Yale and will not be reimbursed; and,
  - No deductible will be charged to the department if the claim is fully covered by the insurance.
- Domestic Car Rental from non-preferred vendors:
  - Do NOT purchase insurance coverage for rentals within the 48 contiguous states or the District of Columbia - insurance will be provided by the University; and,

- International car rentals (no difference b/w preferred/non-preferred vendors):
  - DO purchase insurance coverage including LDW (Loss Damage Waiver; formerly called CDW or collision damage waiver) and LIS (Liability Insurance Supplement) for rentals outside the contiguous 48 states, including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, from both preferred and non-preferred vendors. This cost will be reimbursed.
  - For claims, no deductible will be charged to the department if the claim is fully covered by insurance.

## Lodging

- Travelers are expected to choose the official conference hotel. Only the single occupancy conference rate will be reimbursed.

  Where multiple conference hotel options are available, acceptable hotels would include Marriott, Hyatt, Starwood.; Examples of unacceptable hotels would include: Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton etc.)

- Reimbursement will not be approved for 'destination CME conferences' (conferences provided by a third party i.e. non-societal organizers) or where hotel charges are greater than $500 (including taxes and fees)/night
- The hotel stay will only be reimbursed up to the duration of the conference, the night before and night the conference ends to allow the traveler to arrive the day before the conference begins and to leave no later than the day after the conference ends.
- Double booking, failure to cancel reservations, no-shows, excessive damage, housekeeping, or additional costs resulting in penalties caused by the traveler are the responsibility of the traveler.

EXCEPTIONS may be made when the penalty was unavoidable due to business reasons or circumstances beyond the traveler's control, e.g. scheduling conflict for work, weather conditions.

- Room upgrade, in-room movie rentals or additional costs resulting in upgrades caused by the traveler are the responsibility of the traveler.
- Room service and meals at the hotel restaurant are reimbursable. (Note: if meals are submitted for reimbursement, the traveler must use the actual costs for meals versus per diem for the entire trip)
- One-day travel, within 50 miles of a regular work location, is not eligible for lodging reimbursement.
- Travelers are permitted to use alternate hotels or Airbnb for lodging. The costs for these alternate accommodations must not be more than the discounted conference hotel rate. The preferred method for arranging Airbnb lodging is the Yale Airbnb for Business platform, using a Yale email address. The preferred method of payment for Airbnb is the Yale P-Card.

## Airport Car Services

- Airport car services to New York are becoming increasingly expensive and there are now reliable alternatives to limo transfers. For those who do not want to drive and pre-book parking at the airport, Lyft/Uber provide bookable rides and cost around $200 each way, plus tolls. Any transfer overages would need to be a personal expense. Per department travel policy, a preferred vendor must be used. For a list of preferred vendors, refer to Private Car Service.

## Meals

- Travelers must choose between actual meal expenses or per diem for reimbursement.
  (Note: The two methods may not be combined on the same trip)
- When meals are provided by another source, included in the cost of meeting registration and/or when traveling for a partial day, the per diem will be prorated as follows: 20% Breakfast, 30% Lunch, and 50% Dinner.
- Should the faculty member have dietary restrictions, an email to the business office in advance of the meeting outlining this is required. In addition, the faculty member should provide a request to the conference organizer seeking alternative meal accommodations.
- Business dinners are expected to be reasonable and to total no more than $125 per person including tax and tip.
