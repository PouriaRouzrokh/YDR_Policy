# Leave of Absence

# Sabbatical & Triennial Leaves of Absence

The leave of absence policies for sabbatical and triennial leaves described here apply to faculty in the Traditional Track, Investigator Track, Clinician-Educator Track, and Clinician-Scholar Track. Note that the Leave of Absence policy for the School of Medicine differs from the policy set forth in the Yale University Faculty Handbook.

## School of Medicine Sabbatical and Triennial Leave Policy

Faculty members become eligible for an initial Sabbatical or Triennial Leave after having taught at the rank of Associate Professor or Professor for two years. The Initial Leave of Absence may be a triennial or a sabbatical.

**Deadline:** The deadline for submitting a request for Sabbatical or Triennial Leave of Absence beginning on or after July 1, for any academic year, is **January 16** of the previous academic year. ( e.g., requests for leaves effective during the 2015-2016 academic year must be received by January 16, 2015 ). This is an absolute deadline. There can be NO EXCEPTIONS made to this policy.
