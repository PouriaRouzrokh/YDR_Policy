| Reviewed: All Yale Radiology Division Chiefs |

1. If the patient has left the department, use critical test result communication.
2. If the patient is still in the department, the radiologist and technologist discuss the case. The patient waits with the technologist. The radiologist reviews the case and attempts to contact the ordering (or covering) provider. If the patient is unstable, call 155 (adult or pediatric medical emergency) or 911.
3. The patient's immediate management is discussed with the ordering (or covering) provider. Options might include ED transfer, assessment at the outpatient clinic, or discharge home with medical follow-up.
4. If the patient needs to go to the ED (including when there is a finding that likely warrants immediate attention and the ordering provider team cannot be contacted):
   a. The radiologist should call the ED triage contact (numbers below) and give a verbal sign-out to the RN or covering provider that an outpatient is being transferred from Radiology to the ED.
      - The radiologist can write a note in the chart OR
      - Ensure the radiology report is viewable in Epic with an impression explaining the ED transfer.
   b. A radiologist should speak with the patient in person or via phone (whenever feasible) and explain:
      - Why they need to go to the ED
      - Whether the ordering provider was reached or not
      - Technologists can assist in patient communication as needed
   c. At facilities where an ED is present, the Radiology RN or technologist will transfer (or arrange the transfer) to ED check-in where care is handed off to the ED team.
   d. At off-site locations with no ED, the technologist or Radiology RN would call 911 when directed to arrange for ambulance transfer.
5. Technologists must complete the case, i.e. end the exam before the patient leaves the department.
