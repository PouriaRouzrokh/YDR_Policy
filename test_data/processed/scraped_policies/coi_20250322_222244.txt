YDR Conflict of Interest Policy

Principals for External Clinical Consulting  Educational Activities

For engagement in sponsored research in consulting education or in other interactions with external organizations

Yale Diagnostic Radiology YDR has articulated the following principles to help faculty members identify and address potential actual and apparent conflicts of interest and commitment associated with external clinical and educational activities The fundamental premise is that each member of the Yale community has an obligation to act in the best interest of the University and in furtherance of the Universitys mission and must not let outside activities or outside financial interests interfere with those obligations Yale Universitys complete policy on conflict of the interest and conflict of commitment can be viewed at httpsprovostyaleedu

The following principles may help YDR faculty members identify and avoid potential conflicts of interest and commitment associated with external clinical and educational activities

1 External activities should not compromise an individuals ability to perform ALL the activities henceforth known as YDR duties expected of him or her as a YDR faculty member including
   a expected clinical and academic responsibilities
   b requirements as stipulated for the clinical supplement ie requirements necessary for adequate functioning of YDR as a whole

2 Time commitments for external activities should be realistically assessed such that they should not compromise YDR duties
   a This is especially true when one takes on multiple external activities
   b External commitments must not preclude one from being available for emergency clinical coverage

3 YDR facilities equipment and personnel should be used only for YDR activities and purposes such as teleradiology except when other uses are specifically authorized by the YDR Chair University resources should not be used for external consulting activities including outside legal work that are not performed under contract with Yale University Such resources include conference rooms secretarial support and office supplies

4 External clinical activities at competing institutions may represent a conflict of interest unless there is a reciprocal benefit to YDR

5 Lectures at outside institutions must also be presented to YDR trainees within a 2 year period if material is deemed appropriate for the trainees

6 Faculty members must update their conflict of interest and conflict of commitment disclosures with each new external activity

These principles are intended to increase the awareness of YDR faculty members to potential conflicts of interest and commitment associated with external clinical and educational activities
